06722250068b4161a0ec25e86be99061,Sherlock Holmes Chapter One,"Nov 15, 2021",82,127,For Adult (A),44.99,11,"As Sherlock, your legacy is written by the decisions you make in this open world detective adventure. Deception, violence, and deduction are just a few resources in your arsenal—your mysterious companion and sounding board, Jon, is another. Whether you choose brute force to solve problems or stay one step ahead of your enemies by using your wits to spot vulnerabilities, you decide what each situation demands as you hone your investigative skills. It’s time to confront your past so you can become the legend you’re destined to be. KEY PILLARS The Man Before: As a cavalier young Sherlock on the precipice of adulthood, you’ll earn your reputation in a way no game or story has explored before. We’ve never seen the youthful arrogance and naiveté of the man before the legend—now you’re living it. Global Investigation: You never know where your next clue will come from. Explore and exploit the entire city in your pursuit of truth, using clues, rumors, disguises, tags, and pinned evidence to build a solid case within your mind palace. And Stay Down: Weapons might help you in a pinch, but there’s something to be said for style—and you have it in spades. Spot enemy vulnerabilities with your brilliant observation skills, or exploit the environment to take someone down while keeping your own hands clean. A Different Jon: Before John Watson, there was a different Jon - your best and only friend. But who is he, really? A Darkening Tide: Set in the 19th century, the vibrant island in the Mediterranean promises anything but paradise. Political corruption and crime run rampant while the islanders cling to tradition and eschew outsiders, making your job even more difficult. Truth and Lies: There are two sides to every story, and the proud islanders have their own ideas about truth and justice. It’s up to you to decide whether uncovering the truth will do more harm than good—and how that will shape the man you’ll become.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Arabic', 'Czech', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish', 'Ukrainian']","['English', 'Ukrainian']","“It's a detective's paradise” 8/10 – PC Gamer “Sherlock Holmes Chapter One is gorgeous in graphics, with in-depth gameplay mechanics, and a deep, emotional story about mental health and trauma compile it into the masterpiece that it is.” 10/10 – Gamegrin “A great story powered by solid writing, charming characters, varied cases, and new open-world gameplay mechanics that fit incredibly well” 8.5/10 – Wccftech",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/header.jpg?t=1648025947,https://sherlockholmes.one,http://frogwares.com/support/,support@frogwares.com,True,False,False,39,18934.67,Frogwares,Frogwares,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud","Action,Adventure","Detective,Open World,Story Rich,Mystery,Action,Crime,Choices Matter,Adventure,Action-Adventure,Atmospheric,Investigation,Combat,Exploration,Third Person,Multiple Endings,Narration,Psychological,Thriller,Emotional,Drama","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_2e203d79cdca27b3553461cc7d789842853ff189.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_3bbeb9b161b431b817ae90d0ed27ec9cd9d97f0e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_4dbb83e746e4684621e4d60da5b3b75ac1465926.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_2dee7b32fad9c72c9071ffa4847f1951293659db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_0b1b2d52a2dc6ad88084621befd034f112b5f949.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_c34ee7216f70ae6f90f1e50dcac07b2134362c50.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_631250287f0d9faefde8badf998080e93180790a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_ba7cdfec96d17110fbde7b5b57704f740acd3aec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_375535119d5190bfa4784ba57a3fac510f10c57c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_f0ec8c52e34cfe60cab609fb47552c52915e99cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1137300/ss_66e20aee4a019cd33f414c974e4c9e18f863dac9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1648025947","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256838768/movie_max.mp4?t=1623663809,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256827353/movie_max.mp4?t=1616753526,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256799246/movie_max.mp4?t=1598885161"

Rayton, the former soldier in the resistance war, has been living in seclusion since then.

And he never expects that he has been involved in a bigger scheme between the mafia, the rebellion, and the legion.

16b7c8509ea8427898981145d244316c,ARK: Survival Evolved,"Aug 27, 2017",92,98215,Everyone (E),29.99,15,"As a man or woman stranded naked, freezing and starving on the shores of a mysterious island called ARK, you must hunt, harvest resources, craft items, grow crops, research technologies, and build shelters to withstand the elements. Use your cunning and resources to kill or tame &amp; breed the leviathan dinosaurs and other primeval creatures roaming the land, and team up with or prey on hundreds of other players to survive, dominate... and escape! Dinosaurs, Creatures, &amp; Breeding! -- over 100+ creatures can be tamed using a challenging capture-&amp;-affinity process, involving weakening a feral creature to knock it unconscious, and then nursing it back to health with appropriate food. Once tamed, you can issue commands to your tames, which it may follow depending on how well you’ve tamed and trained it. Tames, which can continue to level-up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow-capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T-Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life-cycle with its own predator &amp; prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg-based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies! You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants &amp; meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long-distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing &amp; armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage &amp; extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system! By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi-leveled structures composed of complex snap-linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per-pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing &amp; armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style. Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians &amp; vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non-violent manner! By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god-like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end-game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated. Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass-codes to provide access your shared village! All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level-Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level-Up your tames, and learn new 'Engrams' to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D 'Explorer Notes'. By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose! Everything you craft has durability and will wear-out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted &amp; stolen, so to achieve security you must build-up, team-up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force-feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames! The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above-ground, below-ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in-game ARK-map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text &amp; voice chat, or long-distance radio. Construct &amp; draw in-game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray... And yet.. how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end-game is planned. On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in-game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time -- special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World-map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited-run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises. You can play single-player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player-hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create! The over-the-top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly-customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting &amp; global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) &amp; true-to-life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

Local and online co-operative play through the whole campaign! Story London, 1888 . After a decade of war with the Lunar invaders we named the Selenites, the British Empire finally vanquished the insect-like menace thanks to a dashing officer by the name of Hugo Wells. He crushed the colony’s queen and in doing so cemented his status as both a hero of the empire, and the de facto patriarch of the drone-like Selenites. Following the war, the Selenites became the new workforce of our industrial revolution, ushering in a new era of progress and prosperity. Freed from the shackles of employment, man could pursue more earthly endeavors. However, listlessness and disobedience rampaged throughout the middle and working classes. In order to satiate the masses, Hugo Wells conceived of the ultimate entertainment. An elite sport where only the bravest, the fastest and the most worthy warriors could wage a petty war against the enslaved Selenite hordes.

Its setting offers unique playgrounds for players to brawl and test their skills to the limit, making Speed Brawl one of the most fun games I’ve played this year.” 8/10 – Nerd Bacon “Speed Brawl flew under my radar initially, and I am so glad I was given the chance to take it for a ride. Between the absolutely jaw dropping intro sequence, the beautiful art style and the on-point voice acting, this game is awesome.

Surreal and fantastical environments, teeming with exotic creatures that defy description. This world is both terrifying and awe-inspiring, as full of wonder and mystery as it is dangerous. But whatever dangers can be found pale in comparison to this world’s biggest threat: The Cylinder. This gargantuan, ancient rolling structure crushes everything in its path. But where did it come from? And how can it be stopped? In this place, you are but a tiny creature called a Trebhum. While you may not be the fastest or the strongest, you have the most powerful ability of all: adaptation. Trebhum can mutate and evolve new physical attributes and abilities that can help them defend themselves against predators and navigate through this perilous world; what you lack in size, you’ll need to make up for in improvisation and resourcefulness. So, prepare yourself, little Trebhum. Gather your family for the dangerous journey ahead and save your world from The Eternal Cylinder. An unforgettable alien world to explore… A vast, open world that contains four unique biomes, each filled with extraordinary flora and strange fauna. What wonders, or horrors, lie ahead will surely be unforgettable. …with real-time world destruction. Every time The Cylinder roars to life, more of your beautiful planet is crushed under the weight of the ancient destroyer. Trees fall creating obstacles to escape while hills and mountains are flattened leaving nowhere to hide. Your only chance of survival is to run! Build Your Own Alien Family Each Trebhum can choose from 50+ mutations that give them the ability to grow spikes, shoot tornadoes, fly, and more! This allows Trebhum various methods to overcome any obstacle they face!

Your task is to lead the rag-tag Void Bastards out of the Sargasso Nebula. You make the decisions: where to go, what to do and who to fight. And then you must carry out that strategy in the face of strange and terrible enemies. On board derelict spaceships you’ll plan your mission, taking note of the ship layout, what hazards and enemies you might encounter and what terminals and other ship systems you can use to your advantage.. Move carefully through the dangerous ships, searching for supplies and manipulating control systems. React to what you find - will you detour to the generator to bring the power back online or will you fight your way into the security module to disable the ship’s defenses? Choose carefully when to fight, when to run and when just to be a bastard. Use your hard won supplies to improvise tools and weapons, from the distracting robo-kitty to the horribly unstable clusterflak. Navigate your tiny escape pod through the vast nebula. Flee from void whales and pirates, and politely avoid the hungry hermits. All the while you must keep scavenging for the food, fuel, and other resources that keep you alive. Void Bastards features a 12-15 hour campaign that you can complete with an endless supply of prisoners, each with their own unique traits. When one dies, another steps forward to carry on the fight. Don’t worry though, as any crafting progress you’ve made is retained from one to another.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857980/header.jpg?t=1625007905,http://www.voidbastards.com,,support@bluemanchu.com,True,True,False,24,13646.15,Blue Manchu,Humble Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on TV","Action,Strategy","FPS,Action Roguelike,Shooter,Singleplayer,Rogue-like,Immersive Sim,Stealth,First-Person,Comic Book,Strategy,Procedural Generation,Action,Sci-fi,Stylized,Space,Crafting,Indie,Gore,Rogue-lite,Violent","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857980/ss_0b7e57e1a6c195d0c921a88d73e312222eeca24d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007905,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857980/ss_8acea8cdb33ffca532ac68444c546ccf221a7f3b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007905,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857980/ss_47fd21b1dacf02e37b11bd6729dc45195d85de6a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007905,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857980/ss_b156dba5bb92c63727b5be8bad2ea06b42f4d13a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007905,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857980/ss_9424ea5f469a2a0c77eaf613333be8686d551b56.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007905,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857980/ss_7d6bc34c7ce11f96a40b37d42478793ce70bb26f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007905,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857980/ss_7dc4cbb8e42d5150100c02c176576b3870203e31.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007905,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/857980/ss_2ece3c15c5b99a9197c30f6d605115ebdf99642b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007905",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256735003/movie_max.mp4?t=1541884140

Spelldrifter combines the puzzle-like positional tactics of a turn-based RPG battle with the deep customizability and replayability of a collectible card game. The result: a hybrid, wherein players must juggle the resources at their disposal using both time and space. With Spelldrifter's innovative Tick System, players are challenged to think of card game strategy in a new light. With each character action, the turns interweave on a single timeline. With mastery of the timeline, players gain great advantage in battle and earn the satisfaction of decisive victory. Select your party of heroes, build your decks, and embark on an adventure deep into Starfall as you search for the entrance to the mysterious Labyrinth! Before you jump into Spelldrifter, get to know each of the playable characters. Each character has a complex backstory and a unique set of cards that can aid you in defeating your enemies. Introducing the Twice-Born warrior Korghan. Before being left for dead by his so-called companions, he was a man of greed and vanity. Now, he is using his second chance at life to gain answers and face his past. Korghan is an experienced warrior who deals powerful blows to your enemies. The Clobber card allows you to deliver multiple strikes at once by dealing 7 damage to a chosen enemy and 3 to any others in the nearby area. Orphaned at a young age, Faydin was a lone wolf in Starfall. She was forced to become a smart and resilient fighter to survive the cut-throat streets. She seeks vengeance from those responsible for her situation. Faydin's strength and agility combined with Korghan's skills provide a powerful team who pummel your enemies until their defeat. Her Hew card deals a devastating seven damage to an enemy, bringing them to their knees. Lavella the Star-Touched is a divine fighter with the mission of defeating evil powers. Blessed by the gods, she can provide healing and cast far range spells to aid in battle. Join her in her fight for peace and virtue! Lavella has the ability to call directly upon the gods to aid in battle. Her cards are long range and powerful. The Spear of Annox is a windup card that targets the enemy from afar and hits them with a crushing 8 damage. Renna is an Embermage, whose quest for knowledge may lead her down a dangerous path. With her younger brother, Vann, she seeks to learn more about her abilities and utilize them outside of the classroom. Select Renna if you like to attack from afar. Use cards like Crush of Boulders, a long distance spell which drops powerful boulders and defeats your enemy, no matter how big. Rohin is one of the most infamous thieves in all of Starfall, and when tasked with stealing from the biggest thug in the city, he’ll do whatever it takes to prove himself. He brings stealth and trickery to your battle. Rohin allows you to evade damage using dodge cards and stealthily attack you opponent. The Dodge Card avoids blows for a full turn, and the Aim from Within Card hits with 3 damage from afar.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Arabic', 'Dutch', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish']","['English', 'Turkish']","“The game successfully blends the positional tactics of a turn-based RPG like Fire Emblem, and layers a deck-building system like Hearthstone or Slay the Spire on top to power your attacks, blocks and other actions.” IGN",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1766750/header.jpg?t=1645828269,https://www.freerangegames.com/spelldrifter,https://www.freerangegames.com/,,True,False,False,0,5537.93,Free Range Games,Free Range Games,"Single-player,Full controller support",RPG,"Tactical RPG,Turn-Based Tactics,PvE,Card Game,RPG,Strategy RPG,Female Protagonist,3D,Top-Down,Steampunk,Swordplay,Controller,Deckbuilding,Turn-Based Combat,Realistic,Dark Fantasy,Dystopian,Fantasy,Magic,Class-Based","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1766750/ss_153525a891d2830542d47b9c8e1b84ccccb0cd5e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645828269,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1766750/ss_1ea6c3bcf683a921739d74fc9cda61a009fe46bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645828269,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1766750/ss_1668e90b0a92cc9ad980f4284389d1b9492bd0f3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645828269,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1766750/ss_27b04409b16e90d80fb2f44a002c708664fc1439.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645828269,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1766750/ss_5ef5708e2caaba0d81430554aa07e7f6069b0199.1920x1080.jpg?t=1645828269","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256854923/movie_max.mp4?t=1642102580,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256872831/movie_max.mp4?t=1644428788,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256872570/movie_max.mp4?t=1644358747,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256870686/movie_max.mp4?t=1643152530"

Passive Co-Op Multiplayer As you adventure through Ashen , you'll occasionally encounter other players in a massive open world, akin to the passive multiplayer of Journey. It's up to you to decide how to deal with them - fight together against evil, invite them into your party or simply ignore them. Souls with a Twist Ashen is faithful to the 'souls' genre of stamina-based combat, introducing players to a punishing yet satisfyingly vast world. But here’s the twist - no two gameplay experiences are alike. Whether you’re exploring bogs, investigating a fjord or pillaging an old palace, where you are at any given moment will dramatically alter the course of your adventure. It's a brutal open world; you're just living in it. Creatures + Combat Ashen has no shortage of dangerous encounters, from hostile enemies to indigenous creatures. You'll be rewarded for studying the environment and its inhabitants, planning your adventure rather than flying by the seat of your pants. The flora and fauna within the world aren't just fantastical; they're often fatal. Each confrontation, no matter how trivial, has potentially dire consequences. Crafting is Key As you discover survivors, you'll have the choice to invite them to your Town. But these aren't mere adventurers - they're potential collaborators, bringing a plethora of crafting skills, from blacksmithing to foraging expertise, in tow. Story + Score Famed fantasy author Mark Lawrence ( The Broken Empire trilogy) and renowned band Foreign Fields collaborated closely with the development team at A44 to craft a cohesive and unique narrative and sound.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Latin America']","['English', 'Spanish - Latin America']","“The relationships you forge define your adventure through Ashen, and helping your new friends is a powerful motivator that drives you forward through the game's beautiful world.” 9/10 – Gamespot “Its passive co-op features offer new insights into the genre, and the variety of its beautiful world is an absolute joy.” 8.5/10 – PC Gamer “Ashen takes liberally from Dark Souls when it comes to combat and progression, but it’s a very good take on the formula that delivers satisfying, strategic combat and progression that rewards careful play.

Gradient-heavy backdrops, track-side objects whizzing past at improbable speeds, and crashes merely slowing your car as it pirouettes through the air, before allowing you to resume your dash to the finish line.” Rock Paper Shotgun",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/header.jpg?t=1636137433,http://www.horizonchaseturbo.com/,http://www.horizonchaseturbo.com,support@aquiris.com.br,True,True,True,48,22157.81,AQUIRIS,AQUIRIS,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,In-App Purchases,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards,Remote Play on TV,Remote Play Together","Action,Casual,Indie,Racing,Sports","Racing,Casual,Indie,Arcade,Sports,Retro,Action,Local Multiplayer,Great Soundtrack,4 Player Local,Split Screen,Local Co-Op,Singleplayer,Driving,1990's,Colorful,Multiplayer,Old School","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_16181d2ac2bbe7701009628254d3b85659b46fbe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_d3bedf4c9bbbae98aea9f0e8081b00517e498004.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_ea805d6a76e2e44c8b748e7c8c3ca66d6cf0e9db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_6fee4ab9c9687e0cb76900f19fd27f9bec9e51e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_0a7f21ebe054e4a3e7f93990a4cd3f3ba0092aa5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_2b9b51f3a523bb5dd1dfb96f2035486af90c53e7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_26e9cecfec13b84c849c1e897638495135334f2e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_d7b78c117505fd664d3d9c9c08131aea7b450324.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_2cb11a96f2031370f037762b1e51ba0d0ec6e21d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_d42bae8163e4a55f4294fb276eb691c0e6b5f025.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_fd0151d6bd91f80c7a85d44388ce0275dcc5ef8d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_289697fc0b804de1a2ae8e31a1139b250fff7f5a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_758b344e1a876d16fc1f9a5fa2a53e98b09c4b87.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_4808ea5c1b65ffefe131b4f23be364129054d87f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_777d796ee5dc3394aeed92bd15ac2004850f0dcb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_8e95253763edcf8214ac62f1cce15c365c1becbe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_1e25b6bd98d58f26746f83e047dc008587010888.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_f06e4b18b627f9fe52998a16817a2c23aaf31783.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/389140/ss_d7eb3a6de2a7a3cb43a9f52d5035a3c4da990721.1920x1080.jpg?t=1636137433","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256716531/movie_max.mp4?t=1526347625,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256745967/movie_max.mp4?t=1553205344,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256732291/movie_max.mp4?t=1539700958,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256720712/movie_max.mp4?t=1529694859"

f24e1ebf9a054781abc85bc82a2dcbba,The Long Dark,"Aug 1, 2017",102,1774,Everyone (E),34.99,2,"Bright lights flare across the night sky. The wind rages outside the thin walls of your wooden cabin. A wolf howls in the distance. You look at the meager supplies in your pack, and wish for the days before the power mysteriously went out. How much longer will you survive? Welcome to THE LONG DARK , the innovative exploration-survival experience Wired magazine calls 'the pinnacle of an entire genre'. The Long Dark is a thoughtful, exploration-survival experience that challenges solo players to think for themselves as they explore an expansive frozen wilderness in the aftermath of a geomagnetic disaster. There are no zombies -- only you, the cold, and all the threats Mother Nature can muster. The episodic story-mode for The Long Dark, WINTERMUTE, includes four of the five episodes that form WINTERMUTE. Episodes 1+2 were given a complete overhaul in December 2018, as part of the Redux Update: new mission structure, story beats, dialogue, animations etc. EPISODE ONE - “DO NOT GO GENTLE” Bush pilot Will Mackenzie (player character) and Dr. Astrid Greenwood are separated after their plane crashes deep in the Northern Canadian wilderness in the aftermath of a mysterious flash of light in the sky. Struggling to survive as he desperately searches for Astrid, Mackenzie comes across the small town of Milton, where he begins to understand the scope of this quiet apocalypse. EPISODE TWO - “LUMINACE FUGUE” Mackenzie’s search for Astrid takes him deeper into the savage Winter wilderness. A mysterious trapper may be the key to finding Astrid, but can he be trusted? EPISODE THREE - 'CROSSROADS ELEGY' In the aftermath of events in Milton, an enigmatic stranger rescues Dr. Astrid Greenwood (player character) from near death. Facing the blizzards of Pleasant Valley, Astrid must bring all her skills as a doctor to bear on the survivors she encounters. But will she find Mackenzie, and get closer to the mystery that's taking them to Perseverance Mills? EPISODE FOUR - 'FURY, THEN SILENCE' A murderous gang of convicts has captured Mackenzie. Desperate to escape one of the darkest corners of Great Bear Island, he must somehow survive his fiercest enemy yet. Can Mackenzie recover the Hardcase, continue his search for Astrid, and also save the innocents caught up in this deadly confrontation? The first four episodes of WINTERMUTE represent approximately 30 hours of gameplay. Episode Five is included in the price of the game, and will be unlocked for free as they are released. Features performances by Jennifer Hale, Mark Meer, David Hayter, and Elias Toufexis (Episode Three), and the music of Cris Velasco. Survival Mode is the free-form, non-narrative survival sandbox that has been honed over nearly three years in Early Access. Survival is your only goal, and death your only end. Make your own survival story with every game. NO HAND HOLDING The game challenges players to think for themselves by providing the information but never the answers. You have to earn the right to survive. PERMADEATH When you die in Survival Mode, your save is deleted. Every decision matters. [Note that WINTERMUTE does not feature permadeath. CONDITION &amp; CALORIES Monitor your Hunger, Thirst, Fatigue, and Cold as you struggle to balance resources with the energy needed to obtain them. Every action costs Calories, and time is your most precious resource. Choose your path carefully. SCOUR THE WORLD FOR SUPPLIES Over 100 gear items including Tools, Light Sources, Weapons, First Aid supplies, Clothing, and more. A VAST LIVING WORLD Explore a 50 square kilometre Northern Canadian wilderness in search of precious supplies. In Winter. Dynamic time of day, weather, wildlife presence, etc. provide just enough randomness to keep things challenging. SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST Hunt, fish, trap, climb, map, search for life-saving food and gear items, and try to avoid dying from the hostile wildlife, succumbing to hypothermia, frostbite, or dysentery (amongst other uncomfortable afflictions), find and maintain your life-saving gear. Hunt and be hunted by: Wolves, Bears, Moose, Rabbits, Deers, Crows, and more to come in future updates. CHOOSE YOUR EXPERIENCE Four distinct Experience Modes let you find a challenge level you are comfortable with, such as Pilgrim Mode, which is meant to be quiet and pensive, all the way to Interloper Mode, where only the most experienced survivors have a chance to last a week. If none of the four Experiences suits you, use Custom Mode settings to tailor your Survival Mode game to your specific tastes. Features the music of Sascha Dikiciyan. Several standalone Challenge Modes offer objective-based experiences designed to last 1-3 hours each, such as Whiteout -- the race to gather enough supplies to prepare for a monster blizzard. Or Hunted, where you need to escape a murderous Bear. Complete them to unlock Feats that provide long-term gameplay benefits in Survival Mode. Five Challenges exist at launch, with more on the way in future updates. In addition to releasing the remaining episode of WINTERMUTE, we intend to continue updating Survival Mode, as we have done with about 100 updates/hotfixes over the past three years of Early Access. Keep in mind that your purchase of The Long Dark entitles you to all five episodes of WINTERMUTE, as well as the free updates we release to Survival Mode along the way..

In assuming the role of Flight Director of mission control, you'll need to manage your spacecraft's resources and solve strategic challenges in turn-based missions in order to succeed. But beware: space is a very unforgiving environment. These are the critical moment-to-moment decisions of mission control; do you spend power to fix a malfunctioning antenna or save it in case of an oxygen leak? Perhaps risking that extra three months of mission planning could have avoided this issue? Mars Horizon has been made with the input and support of the European Space Agency (ESA) and the UK Space Agency. We’ve collaborated with numerous experts in space exploration from the ESA in creating Mars Horizon. From engineers developing the technology used in Mars programmes, to those designing the next generation of missions, bringing an unprecedented level of authenticity, realism and legitimacy to the gameplay and its scenarios. Dig deeper into the game via our podcast, including discussions with staff from the European Space Agency and UK Space Agency.

750df8e7b019463786110e45fda1e636,Dead by Daylight,"Jun 14, 2016",42,46073,For Adult (A),7.99,34,"Death Is Not an Escape. Dead by Daylight is a multiplayer (4vs1) horror game where one player takes on the role of the savage Killer, and the other four players play as Survivors, trying to escape the Killer and avoid being caught, tortured and killed. Survivors play in third-person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first-person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. More information about the game is available at Key Features • Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? • Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. • A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. • Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. • Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog. WARNING: PHOTOSENSITIVITY/EPILEPSY SEIZURES - READ THIS NOTICE BEFORE PLAYING A very small percentage of people may experience epileptic seizures or blackouts when exposed to certain kinds of flashing lights or light patterns.

You wish you did not have to go outside, but you do. It would be easier to give up. But you don’t. The hardship, the hunger, the thirst. The fear. You keep reminding yourself why you stay alive. Why you do this. Then you hear it. “Daddy you’re back.” You wife’s face lights up and you open a bag full of medical supplies. You need not tell her how you got them. You simply enjoy your small victory in this, the harshest of times. In the post-apocalyptic world, you must keep your family alive in your underground bunker in this deep strategy game from Unicube... Sheltered is a post-apocalyptic disaster management game that gives a whole new meaning to the term “nuclear family”. Given a head-start over the billions lost in a nuclear holocaust, you must gather as many supplies as possible en route to the concrete underground shelter that will soon become your family home for the foreseeable dreary future. With all hope lost, how will you cope in this bleak new world? How you handle the many moral choices you'll encounter on a daily basis could be the difference between your family surviving or dying. Combat claustrophobia, radiation and mental exhaustion as you cling desperately to life in the cramp, cold and scary underground shelter. You’ll have to leave the scant protection the shelter offers behind as you’re forced to venture outside into the dangerous desolate wasteland to scavenge for vital supplies which could ensure your families survival for just one more day. Feature List Family comes first : Keep your family alive and protect them from the ravages of the harsh post-apocalyptic world. Make the shelter a home : Maintain your shelter - keep it secure, habitable and make sure that the family have enough resources to survive. Protect your shelter from hazards and infiltration! Customisation : Your family is unique to you; you decide their gender, names and their appearance.

c5470b4a41b745d5919734d1e2a955bc,Evan's Remains,"Jun 11, 2020",100,4,Everyone (E),6.99,1,"Evan's Remains is a mystery-thriller puzzle adventure about finding a missing boy: Evan. The game combines logic-based platform puzzles with narrative inspired by Japanese graphic adventure games. Gameplay: Every time the player solves from two to three puzzles, the story goes forward and new mechanics are introduced. The challenge of the puzzles lies in the player’s ability to figure out what do rather than solve challenges based on skill. As the difficulty curve increases, the puzzles become more complex by combining two or more previously introduced mechanics. Story: Evan, the genius boy, has been missing for years. One day, a letter signed by him is received, claiming he’s on an uninhabited island somewhere in the Pacific Ocean.

Set out on a lifelong journey and become an individual able to carve out their own destiny... But remember that freedom never comes cheap. Life in the Great Arknian Empire is harsh and its hardest Lot is yours by the circumstance of birth. You are a commoner, holding no rights and no title. To seize your fate and become the rightful heir to the legacy of the Brante family you will have to come to grips with ossified tradition and prejudice. Embarking on a life-long journey from one's birth until true death, you will have to endure great upheavals, face adversity, and make many difficult choices. Every decision will affect not only the protagonist, his family, and loved ones, but may even topple the foundation of the Empire itself. Key features At the turn of time Every imperial citizen's life is predetermined by their estate. The deities known as the Twin Gods have bestowed this truth to the world, dividing mortals into Lots.

Your choice is not an illusion Divided into chapters, the game keeps track of the player's deeds, the skills they acquired, as well as other overlapping circumstances that shape a unique plotline for each playthrough. Every decision has its consequences and you will be held accountable throughout the entire journey. To protect your family and loved ones, to impose the rule of the Emperor and make a fortune, or to try and change the world as you see fit...

Fight for your life One man is anything but omnipotent in this realm yet under your guidance, Sir Brante may become a person who can endure every trial fate throws at him and rewrite the very laws that govern his world! Develop and train your character, leveling up such traits as determination, sensitivity, and endurance. All of the hero's skills, starting with those acquired in infancy, will affect his personality, worldview, and relationships, ultimately unlocking new talents and possible storylines.

Numerous branching paths that affect the unfolding story will make every playthrough a unique experience: become a noble judge, learn the ways of the inquisition, plot a revolution as a member of a secret society, or embrace an entirely different purpose. Be brave and fate itself shall bend to your will!

Nowak - you are the Riftbreaker, an elite scientist/commando inside a powerful Mecha-Suit. Enter a one-way portal to Galatea 37, a distant planet at the far reaches of the Milky Way Galaxy, with the purpose of building up a base that will allow travel back to Earth and further colonization. Ashley's Mecha-suit, which she calls 'Mr. Riggs', can withstand the harshest environmental conditions and has a full range of equipment for base construction, resource extraction, gathering specimens and of course - combat. It is capable of traveling through rifts that connect space across vast distances. BASE BUILDING Your task is to construct a two-way rift back to Earth. It is a very complex invention and requires enormous amounts of energy. Simple solar collectors and a few tons of steel will not be enough. You will need to build up a complex chain of mines, refineries, powerplants and research facilities to complete this mission. DEFENSE Your presence on this planet will not go unnoticed. As you build up your industry and disrupt the natural order, the world will start seeing you as a threat. Build up your defenses. Construct walls, barriers and defense towers as the attacks get stronger with every passing day. You will face thousands of hostile creatures trying to eliminate your presence. EXPLORATION Galatea 37 is an unknown planet in the Sycorax belt of the Milky Way galaxy. Long distance surveys detected that it is inhabitable and perfect for colonization. The planet is full of rare minerals and substances that can be found in various locations around the globe. Varied biomes can surprise you with unknown fauna and flora as well as harsh weather conditions. Construct local outposts in resource-rich locations that will transport the required resources using rift technology. CAMPAIGN Take on an epic journey across all the different biomes of Galatea 37. You will establish multiple persistent bases across the globe that will fuel your economy. Research alien substances and lifeforms, as well as fight hordes of alien creatures, clearly not happy with your interference in the natural order of the planet. The campaign spans multiple hours and offers a remarkable degree of freedom in a super detailed, procedurally generated world. You can decide on the order of your priorities and what technologies you want to use. You’re the only human there, after all. SURVIVAL Your mission is to survive a set amount of time, fighting off increasingly difficult waves of enemy creatures. Each mission in the game is randomized, offering nearly endless replayability. SANDBOX If intense fight for survival is not your thing either, then try out the Sandbox mode, where we give you control over the entire game – including resources, enemy spawns, and weather conditions. CUSTOMIZE YOUR GAMEPLAY The Riftbreaker™’s gameplay can be customized to fit your playstyle. You can change the frequency of enemy attacks as well as their strength and numbers, resource abundance, weather events, enemy damage, and tons of other settings. There are also multiple difficulty presets to suit the needs of both hardcore strategy players as well as those that want a laid-back base-building experience.

Wait, how did you mess up your studio that much that fast? UPGRADE AND DESIGN YOUR STUDIO Not satisfied with the initial look and/or functionality of your studio? That’s okay, because you can always unlock new rooms, buy some furniture and decorations, and place those however and wherever you want — make yourself at home! Wait, what do you mean you don’t have enough money?! SELL AND EXPOSE YOUR ART Sell your paintings at the marketplace, fulfill all your clients' orders, and receive a generous reward, or maybe a gift! Or maybe some exposure, the best of all currencies out there. Don't forget that you can exhibit your amazing art and see what critics have to say about it. REALISTIC PAINTING Painting in SuchArt feels just like in real life, but without the downsides. The colors mix as you would naturally expect them to, so you can easily achieve the result you dreamed about. The paint has realistic texture, and each instrument alters it a bit with different strokes. There’s plenty of instruments to choose from: brushes, palette knives, stencils or even flamethrowers to create your next masterpiece.

d27f08d026774dfbae32d7eb19416709,Death Trash,"Aug 5, 2021",98,27,Everyone (E),19.99,0,"Death Trash features a world where cosmic horrors long for humanity but meet punks with shotguns. Influenced by post-apocalyptic, horror, and cyberpunk classics but with a fresh personality of its own. Death Trash combines the crunch and depth of old-school, role-playing classics with the controls and game feel of modern games. Gameplay Death Trash is an open-world, singleplayer role-playing game with handcrafted levels, a strong story campaign and optional local co-op gameplay. The game features real-time gameplay with ranged and melee combat, stealth, multiple choice dialogue, an inventory of items and worms, a crafting system, and skills like pickpocketing and puking. Travel through a gritty, post-apocalyptic wasteland by world map and explore hand-painted, organic locations. Meet exciting characters, talk to the Fleshkraken, visit the Puke Bar, or descend into old temples in search of expanding your awareness. Customize your own character through stats and making in-game decisions. Experience the story and discover side quests. Fight against machines and larger-than-life monsters. Or become their friend. Death Trash features extensive player freedom: - manual save games - dialogue can be left anytime - kill everyone or... - don't kill anyone! Story Humans traveled to the stars and some of them settled on the planet Nexus with its ancient secrets of stone and flesh. But secrets were unearthed, and the civilized people had to flee into enclosed habitats. The wasteland is reigned now by outcasts, controlling machines, and offsprings of the worm. You are one of the outcasts, pushed outside with a dangerous burden to carry, and your path will take you through deserts, ruins, the underground, and beyond. Singleplayer / Multiplayer Details The main feature of Death Trash is the immersive single-player campaign. But the game also contains a local co-op mode: - Covering the full campaign. The second player can drop in and drop out anytime. - Second player has their own character, stats, inventory etc. but shared quest progress. - Both players are restricted to the same location and traveling on the world map happens together. - Both players can perform actions separately, including dialogue, and don't interrupt each other. - The game has a shared screen mode (default) and a permanent split screen mode. We're not planning an online co-op mode due to limited development resources. We will evaluate this again in the future.

In this story rich experience inspired by Dune and Foundation , each successful run will uncover the truth about the Empire... and yourself as well. Main Features - Space exploration in a procedurally-generated universe - Tactical fights between battleships and their squadron fleets - More than 300 possible story events - A deep and dramatic storyline structured in 6 chapters - A dark and disturbing atmosphere inspired by our favorite S-F universes (Foundation, Dune, Battlestar Galactica) The story: The epic journey of a clone After 700 years of peace and prosperity, the Galactic Empire has suddenly been shattered into pieces . The OMNIs , god-like machines which did everything for their human masters, have mysteriously shut down. And humankind, having long since lost the ability to survive on its own, is dangerously close to extinction. But somewhere in a far corner of the Galaxy is Gehenna, a planet of ice and rock and a top-secret facility that is the pinnacle of Imperial Tech and also humanity’s last chance. You are a clone of Admiral Ellys Idaho , a weapon fashioned from flesh, the best Imperial Admiral ever to battle in the stars and you have just been awoken on this planet by its strange and darkly-humorous Guardian, Kaliban, the last functional OMNI to exist. Your mission: skillfully command a battleship through the Empire's now chaotic, violent clusters ––where one wrong move could be your last–– as you try to reactivate the OMNIs and save the future of all humankind . But you must leave Gehenna now.... for time has almost run out. Platforms Crying Suns is available on PC, Mac, iOS and Android.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese']",[],"“Crying Suns inclusion of a well integrated story in a rogue-lite game marks it out as something of an oddity in the genre. Good design and battles that offer just enough tactical depth that even beginners can enjoy themselves.” 5/5 – Pixel Judge “It is one of those titles I would fully recommend to any strategy fan with sci-fi tastes. It came out of nowhere, flying under my radar and sneakily placing itself in my 2019’s top 10 list.” 9,5/10 – Strategy Informer “Crying Suns does right by its predecessors, all while carving out its own space in the genre. The sci-fi tactics game tosses you into the unknown with a need to find answers and a battleship to blast away the opposition. With solid mechanics and a superb story, it’s a good time waiting to be had.” 8/10 – Game Tyrant",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/header.jpg?t=1625007939,http://www.cryingsuns.com,,contact@cryingsuns.com,True,True,False,65,46473.03,Alt Shift,Humble Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud","Indie,Strategy","Strategy,Space,Indie,Rogue-lite,Pixel Graphics,Sci-fi,Post-apocalyptic,Tactical,Rogue-like,Real-Time with Pause,Story Rich,2D,Singleplayer,Procedural Generation,RTS,Perma Death,Real Time Tactics,Hex Grid,Resource Management,Dark","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_6b9f98cb9395cd5aa9cb9134090c43f417183b5b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_21dc04eb2a200d566a32b9cba650489c21e4c0c1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_91c2850974b45e63b1acf88b1925280db06f02ee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_7548fa6835c9388e082d8ad2e75d016b9fffc073.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_eb410b88c37845edb605e6f50dd197284d178964.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_81be145fd5dbc34189aabdea853f22bb5e347c5f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_c1ff1e8bce82186718b0e66952994cede87dd89d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_3945193ce5aff579bc8552f11781a715519585b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_1d4730c033ceb38efb4a6268c9c98bdf8527f978.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_574b32ceac549277aa6c95142a04a816bd0f9361.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_6e683bcffd44c370e7ac2f7cd00a5a424a4ac33c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_6bc3a81987a1ece7c3e0e30db84462340215f9c2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_03845667847af67f56804f378cc6e32321a81020.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_19ddab0e278377c28aeee09e85e4a71579e13e8d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_1bfd5f78918cacafbbda88593f7c238ee40ba85d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/873940/ss_d9cc305f92fe72e25cb20f150b5c2893e269ee6f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1625007939","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256789332/movie_max.mp4?t=1592240363,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256762290/movie_max.mp4?t=1568751537"

e343cee48e8e4cca80b0ae3d228342aa,Rogue Legacy 2,"Apr 28, 2022",88,1688,Everyone (E),24.99,0,"Rogue Legacy is back! But now it's got a 2 on the end of it! Rogue Legacy 2 is a genealogical rogue-LITE. That means it has all the trappings of a typical rogue-like (randomized runs, changing characters, and more), but with persistent upgrades, and persistent dead heirs. In this game, your legacy defines you. Spend your parents’ inheritance and grow the family manor to give your children a better fighting chance. Each child is unique, with their own traits and abilities. Your daughter could be a Ranger. She could also be vegan. It’s a new experience every time. Rogue Legacy 2 also lets you play how you want to. Go hard and fast, and dive deeper into the depths of a randomly-generated world. Or take it slow and steady and build your character up until you’re ready for greater challenges. Every Adventure is Unique New monsters, new traps, and new layouts await you every time you enter the Kingdom. This is a world where improvisation, and not memorization is the key to success. Wildly New Classes No two classes play the same. Hide atop Ivy Canopies as the Ranger, and rain poisoned arrows down onto your foes. Take to the skies as a Dragon Lancer and fly across the skies striking foes at massive speeds. Or sing and dance through your enemies, as the joyous bard, leaving only a trail of bodies behind you. Rogue Legacy 2 supports 15 new classes, with 15 distinct styles of play. Brand New Style We’re taking a whole new artistic approach to Rogue Legacy 2. The sequel features 2.5D stylings, with 3D characters against hand-drawn backdrops. The art uses heavy shading and all animations are done using stepping techniques to keep the familiar RL look and feel. Revamped Biome Generation We went all-out with biome generation to make each area in RL2 feel completely new. Each biome adopts different “build strategies” to create completely unique yet-still-randomly-generated regions. True Metroidvania To really push the metroidvania flair, RL2 introduces heirlooms: special items that permanently give your heroes new abilities that fully reveal the world’s secrets. These are not basic lock-in-key abilities, but powers that fundamentally change how you play. And heirlooms are not simply handed to you. You must prove your worth, provided you can find them. Traits 2.0 Though fun the first time, the traits in RL1 often wore their welcome later in the game. We’ve now added gold modifiers to entice players to take on new challenges. The more debilitating the trait is (in-game), the bigger the reward. This makes choosing your heirs a meaningful decision every time. Relics and Resolve One of the most exciting new features to Rogue Legacy 2 is the ability to pick up Relics, which are unique items that change how your run is played. Gain stat modifiers, complete special challenges, and even gain brand new abilities as you traverse the kingdom. But be careful, the more Relics you obtain the more your resolve is shaken, and all Relics are lost if your hero perishes. Improved Accessibility We’ve taken accessibility to the next level with the introduction of House Rules. Toggle contact damage, tweak global damage and health, and even give yourself flight for difficult platform sections. You have complete control over how you want to play the game. We’ve also introduced new mechanics such as Off-shore Banking to give struggling players more ways to succeed. A Rich Narrative Not only is the lore to the world of Rogue Legacy greatly expanded in the sequel, but it runs deep. New lore awaits you all the multiple NG’s in. Beating the game once is only the beginning. Learn about the inevitable collapse of a once thriving kingdom, and discover the dark secrets of the ones responsible. And connect and build relationships with the characters you meet along the way. New Game+ for Days Your journey has only begun after beating the final boss in RL2. There is a ton more to explore and discover on multiple playthroughs. You must choose how the game gets harder, from unique biome hazards, to special boss fights.

You explore randomly generated levels based in H.P. Lovecraft stories, fighting cultists and all kinds of monsters from the Mythos, improving your weapons and gear, solving puzzles and challenges, and looking for clues and knowledge to defeat the Great Old Ones and the Outer Gods. LIVE H.P. LOVECRAFT’S STORIES Lovecraft’s Untold Stories is based on H.P. Lovecraft’s stories. You will experience first-hand the cosmic horror created by the genius of Providence. Every character will go through an investigation that will take them through different locations, from the creepy old Victorian mansion to the abandoned hospital where forbidden experiments take place or the jungle where lost tribes celebrate forgotten rituals, just to name a few. Levels are randomly generated: it will be a different experience every time you play. Also, they vary depending on the character you’re playing with. Look for items and clues to unlock secrets and new stories! 5 CHARACTERS, 5 WAYS OF FIGHTING THE MYTHOS You can play as 5 different characters, each with a different playstyle and storyline. A private detective, a witch, a thief, a professor, and even a ghoul—each with different stats, weapons, and combat moves, creating five entirely different gameplay experiences. The Detective offers a balanced playstyle, with average Health and Stamina. The Professor is a specialist in ranged combat, with less Health and a special shield granted by his weapon, the Tillinghast. The Witch does a lot of damage, has teleport abilities and elemental shields of fire and ice, but also a very low Health. The Thief is a specialist in melée combat that takes advantage of its stealth to maximize her damage. The ghoul does a lot of melée damage, has a high Health and regenerates itself, but can’t use medkits at all. DISCOVER THE SECRETS OF THE GREAT OLD ONES The truth of the dark horrors that inhabit the universe is unbearable for any human mind. In the end, you can’t win against the Old Ones. Madness or death await you. But maybe you can delay the inevitable… If you face the Great Old Ones without any knowledge about them, you will go mad just by looking at their hideous features. But spread across every level you will find special items with information about the Great Old Ones. The more you know about them, the stronger your mind shall become – but knowledge is not easy to find, and if you are not thorough in your investigation you might get to the end of a storyline without finding everything that is to know. You will have to play with all the characters if you want to find all the information about every Great Old One! MADNESS AWAITS Insanity crawls behind every corner for those who face the Mythos. In your investigations, you will face different situations where you have to choose what to do – make the wrong decision and you will start losing your mind. In order to face the Great Old Ones, you need knowledge, and to find it you have to explore – but the more you explore the more events that shake your sanity you will find… Those who go mad under the influence of the Mythos take their own life to escape the eternal terror they are now looking at. Not all hope is lost, though – there are some ways to recover your sanity… KEY FEATURES Fight hundreds of different monsters from the Cthulhu Mythos in this intense action roguelite Explore Lovecraft’s stories: every character has a storyline that crosses randomly generated levels set in different locations from Lovecraft’s stories, such as the hospital, the jungle, or the port city just to name a few Face the Great Old Ones: Great Cthulhu, Nyarlathotep, Dagon, Shub-Niggurath, and Azathoth await you in special levels Investigate thoroughly: explore every corner to find secret levels and knowledge about the Great Old Ones Learn about the Mythos to fight them: to have a chance at fighting the Great Old Ones you need to acquire knowledge about them, or their mere presence will drive you insane Madness awaits: in the course of your adventures you will have to make some decisions, and taking the wrong ones will shake your sanity. If it gets too low, you will start losing your mind – and if you go mad you will take your own life to escape the horror Pick your hero: Choose between 5 different characters, detective, the thief, the professor, the witch, and the ghoul Different playstyles: every investigator has a different combat style and skills, but levels also vary depending on who you’re playing them with – so the gameplay experience is totally different Collect and improve weapons, items, and artifacts.

Outsmart, outmaneuver, overpower, outclass your opponents in lightning-fast, adrenaline-inducing single-player space combat. You play as Leon Barret, ace fighter pilot of the Poseidon Security Forces. Here at Poseidon Corp., we are trying to pave the way for the colonization of Mars, as mankind is struggling for survival, split between a depleted hot Earth and a cold, claustrophobic Lunar colony. Your job is to maintain order by eradicating rebels and space pirates, facilitate our scientists' research while keeping them safe, and protect all our personnel from the numerous external threats. Dive down into gigantic asteroid mining plants, shoot down Rebel drones and fighters, roll left and right avoiding enemy fire, unleash impossibly powerful missile volleys, but also race against stray pilots and space scavengers at breakneck speed for the sheer thrill of it. By completing missions you will unlock Cards and Tokens to upgrade your fighter's Hull, Shields, Energy Weapons and Missiles until you are able to go up against massive Capital Ships and single-handedly shift the tide of the war. In an interplanetary struggle where nobody is good or bad, you will experience Leon rising through the ranks, the meaning of “necessary evil”, the cost of integrity and ultimately, what it means to take a stand. FEATURES Career mode - learn every skill you need to survive and triumph in the Redout Universe. Many Thriving Worlds - exotic locations, grandiose events and epic battles beyond every frontier. Deep Gameplay - manifest your tactical superiority by putting your dexterity, quick thinking and adaptability to the test. Bigger, Badder Weapons - From Plasma Cannons to Shock Rays, Railguns, Scattershot, Air-To-Air Missiles, and Loadup Gatlings, a vast array of weapons is at your disposal. Choose, upgrade, and even install multiple instances on your ship. Pimp my Ride - upgrade your spaceship to scale it up: let them come by the dozens, or single-handedly take on a Destroyer Warship! Drop and swap Cards to improve single aspects of your ship and better fit your style. Music for your ears - An entirely dynamic soundtrack that will drop sicker and sicker beats the tougher the experience gets! LOTS TO DO IN SPACE Fight enemy Drones, Fighters and all sorts of enemy ships in rail shooter sections: avoid missiles and buckets of bullets while you take them down one by one. Explore Iridium mines and abandoned space structures in search of hideouts, resources, and Rebels: enjoy the freedom of movement, cut your engine power to squeeze through narrow passages, but be careful not to scratch your paintwork. Race through enemy installations, behind enemy lines, through gigantic space battles, or against space pirates for a quick buck. Assault Capital Ships in specially designed missions that pit you against gigantic vessels: each with unique strengths, weaknesses and special attacks, each a turning point in the narrative of the game! FAST-PACED SPACE ACTION Redout: Space Assault comes with the Redout Adrenaline seal-of-quality. Every ship movement, from rolling to avoid missiles to pushing the limits of your ship via the enhanced boost, will make you feel like you are actually driving a space-capable fighter jet, on the brink of control. You will not need to instantly become a top gun in order to enjoy the game, but you will definitely need some skill if you want to achieve all bonus objectives and max out your fighter stats!","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Portuguese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Dutch', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Turkish']","['English', 'Turkish']","“Graphically flawless, RSA is colorful and far away from the graphic realism of titles like Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen.

bdea68145b61462f9cd17068e835aadf,The Vanishing of Ethan Carter,"Sep 25, 2014",104,5,Everyone (E),19.99,2,"GOOD NEWS EVERYONE : By purchasing the game, you actually get two games now: 1) The original The Vanishing of Ethan Carter, 2) The Unreal Engine 4 remaster called The Vanishing of Ethan Carter Redux. Please see this link for details. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is a first-person story-driven mystery game that focuses entirely on exploration and discovery. It contains no combat or explosions of any kind. If our game leaves any scars, we hope you won’t be able to see them. You play the game as Paul Prospero, an occult-minded detective who receives a disturbing letter from Ethan Carter. Realizing the boy is in grave danger, Paul arrives at Ethan’s home of Red Creek Valley, where things turn out to be even worse than he imagined. Ethan has vanished in the wake of a brutal murder, which Paul quickly discerns might not be the only local murder worth looking into. Inspired by the weird fiction (and other tales of the macabre) from the early twentieth century, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter aims to significantly evolve immersive storytelling in games. While it features a private detective and quite a few mental challenges, The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is not an especially puzzle-ridden game. Our focus is on atmosphere, mood, and the essential humanity of our characters. Still, the discoveries won’t happen on their own, or without your help. Using both Paul’s supernatural skill of being able to communicate with the dead, and your own powers of observation, you will discover the mystery behind a trail of corpses, the roots of a dark ancient force lurking in Red Creek Valley, and the fate of a missing boy. Key Features Explore and interact with the beautiful yet ominous world of Red Creek Valley , which was created with the use of revolutionary photogrammetry technology that allows for nearly photorealistic environments. Communicate with the dead and see how they died in order to gather clues that help you piece together the truth behind Ethan’s disappearance -- and the fate of his family. Experience, in non-linear fashion, a story that combines the pleasures of pulp, private eye, and horror fiction , all of it inspired by writers such as Raymond Chandler, Algernon Blackwood, Stefan Grabinski, and H. P. Lovecraft. Conduct the investigation on your own terms and at your own pace . Although there are a few scary bits in the game, players will have no need for sedatives. Our game is less about terror and more about clammy unease.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Polish', 'Czech']","['English', 'Polish', 'Czech']",“A story told with a level of cleverness and elegance rarely seen in games.” 9/10 – GameSpot “Leaves you with several amazing memories; moments that you will want to talk to your friends about for hours.” 9/10 – EuroGamer “One of the best games of the year.” 9/10 – US Gamer,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/258520/header.jpg?t=1591617818,http://EthanCarterGame.com,,Support@TheAstronauts.com,True,False,False,14,28647.34,The Astronauts,The Astronauts,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on TV","Adventure,Indie","Mystery,Atmospheric,Detective,Walking Simulator,Exploration,First-Person,Adventure,Horror,Story Rich,Singleplayer,Supernatural,Puzzle,Indie,Lovecraftian,Open World,Great Soundtrack,Short,Psychological Horror,Beautiful,Point & Click","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/258520/ss_69872a9956b957c31471be1cd1a58e530cc21a67.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591617818,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/258520/ss_d4d1f6afd513b35f9fed4069b5859cf77d4be3b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591617818,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/258520/ss_2bbc4e208f82fef934f437863011f12d44be310e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591617818,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/258520/ss_9b86bfc8b10ed17804f033a4a8de209fe90a1280.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591617818,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/258520/ss_a7e7253cad63718ba7e29a3c0ba1f0530060f516.1920x1080.jpg?t=1591617818","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2035311/movie_max.mp4?t=1447364660,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2033919/movie_max.mp4?t=1447363163,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2034083/movie_max.mp4?t=1447363340"

Discover Aven Prime - an alien planet of deserts, tundras, and jungles light years from earth. Aven Colony puts you in charge of humanity's first extrasolar settlement, where you build and expand your small colonies into massive, sprawling cities while dealing with the challenges faced when settling on a new world. Build your colony's infrastructure, look after the well-being of your citizens, manage your resources, and guide your colony to prosperity against the backdrop of the harsh and often dangerous realities of the exotic world of Aven Prime. KEY FEATURES: COLONIZE AN ALIEN WORLD: Build a new home for humanity on a world with a low-oxygen atmosphere, extreme electrical storms, shard storms, dust devils, deadly toxic gas eruptions from geothermal vents, and days so long they have their own seasons. Explore a variety of biomes, from the lush wetlands environment to the much less habitable desert and arctic. MEET THE LOCALS: Encounter a variety of alien life forms, including giant sandworms, deadly plague spores, and a vicious fungal infection known as “The Creep.” SUPERVISE YOUR COLONISTS: Settling a new world can be stressful. As a new Colony Governor, you’ll need to work overtime to help your colonists deal with their new environment. Using the 12 distinct 'overlay' modes, you can mange your colony's Crops, Citizens, Happiness, Crime, Air, Electricity, Employment, Resources, Commute, Structures, Drones, and Water. Earn the respect of your colonists, and rise in rank from Colony Governor to Expedition President! DISCOVER THE PAST: The world of Aven Prime holds many secrets. Play through a full single-player campaign and participate in a story that reveals some of the many secrets of this brave new world. BUILD THE FUTURE: Use construction drones to build dozens of types of structures to house your colonists, establish trading routes, welcome immigrants and much more! Enhance your existing buildings through several upgrade tiers to push your colony to new heights! EXPEDITION SYSTEM: Deploy your crack team of pioneers to explore alien ruins, recover artifacts, repair crashed vessels and rescue lost explorers. Get ready to take on plague and creep spore nests whilst fending off splinter groups, rebels and Aven Prime's remaining robot guardians which threaten your new civilisation. PREPARE FOR WINTER: A fully functional day/night and seasonal cycle. During the winter Aven Prime freezes over - farms will not grow food and solar panels will generate far less electricity.

5e7ce1899f0b4871ba393abea8953f57,Sands of Aura,"Oct 21, 2021",96,6,Everyone (E),24.99,0,"A ruinous cataclysm unleashed by a tormented god descended the world of Talamhel into perpetual night. The hourglass of time was shattered and its essence poured across the land, creating an endless sea of sand. The once-flourishing world of Talamhel became a putrid lesion of its former glory and those who called it home are now husks of corruption--violent, undying, unyielding soldiers of death. But Talamhel is not lost--not yet. For generations, the righteous few have endured. You are one of those few. On the eve of your induction into the Order of Remnant Knights, the last protectors of man, Talamhel is once-again wracked by calamity. The corruptive nature of the Night Plague has mutated, and the realm of man needs the Remnant Knights more than ever. Track down the emergent evil and destroy it. Protect the realm of man. From the helm of your nimble grainwake, carve across the perilous sandseas to confront the source of this newfound terror, but don’t expect a guiding light or a red X on a map. You’ll chart your own course forward--behold the open seas, and choose the heading you best see fit. But familiarity is a far-flung concept aboard the grainwake--the shifting sands are always changing, revealing secrets, dangers, and paths unseen. Things are not as they seem… Talamhel is an open world, free to explore and discover as you please Every island is a unique, colorful encounter of combat, lore, and plunder With tiered levels of difficulty, locations offer challenges that will reward those who overcome With a trusted (undead) companion rested in the crow’s nest, you’ll never sail the seas alone The corruption that plagues Talamhel has created a horde comprised of both man and other Talamhelic natives: The venerable Ferrum and the insectoid, hive-minded Hashara. Once warring nations have become an abominable army of undying malice. From doomsday cultists to fallen kings, the foes that guard the answers you seek are determined to see your end. Prepare for an unrelenting, unforgiving combat experience not to be taken lightly. Swing true, dear knight, swing true. With hundreds of weapon components to be reclaimed from the crumbled remains of civilization, there are thousands of unique weapons to be forged. Find the hilt that fits just right. Cleave through the corruption with 7 distinct fighting styles Bolster yourself with dozens of armor sets, each with their own unique defenses Combine and modify your devastation with magical augments, creating a personalized build Starspire is the sanctuary that you call home, and its doors remain open to those you deem worthy of its hearth. Along your journey, you will encounter refugees in need of shelter and a Remnant Knight can see they find it in Starspire. Each person deserving of Starspire will make their new home stronger and safer, but not all are deserving. Working as an optional companion to core gameplay, Starspire offers an opportunity to test your Remnant traits of leadership and judgment. The choices you make regarding Starspire’s residents will alter your story and affect your fate, as well as the fate of others--but only if you choose to make those choices. New Starspire residents unlock perks like gifts of exclusive equipment and unique services Discover the lives of others, their choices and actions, and decide their fate Engage with characters unlike any you’ve ever met, and rebuild a community Decisions not easily made: become familiar with the grey area between right and wrong The symphony of the sands are brought to life with an evocative, soul-stirring soundtrack composed and produced by the incredible Eduardo Lopez. Sands of Aura will feature a fully symphonic soundtrack, with a wide selection of instrumentation--from the haunting strings of the antique Viola Da Gamba to the resonant thunders of a professional Bulgarian choir. These are the unforgettable sounds of Talamhel. The score of a wounded world.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","“With the difficulty of a Dark Souls game and the looting and dungeon crawling of a Diablo, Sands of Aura wraps the whole experience in beautiful Unreal 4 visuals.” RPGFan “One of the most intriguing aspects of Sands of Aura is its weapon crafting system.

09846ff4dda3466f9a8bddbe07c22727,Rebel Cops,"Sep 17, 2019",97,13,Everyone (E),9.99,0,"Rebel Cops is a spin-off game from This Is the Police , which exclusively focuses on the series' turned-based tactical operations. Lead a ragtag squad of cops in rebellion against their town's new criminal power to see how long you can hold out when you're constantly short on supplies and a single shot can cost a cop their life. You’re not exactly the police, but you're the only ones on the side of justice Viktor Zuev, a sadistic crime boss new on the scene, has quickly taken the town of Ripton by the throat. The community's leaders and local police have surrendered to his will. A master of intimidation and blackmail, Zuev has seized every major business in town, all of which he now controls as his own private fiefdom. An outlaw band of renegade cops refuses to bow, however. With little hope of success, they fight on — for justice, and the soul of their town. Gunfights are thrilling, but stealth is key You're fighting a guerilla war, out-manned and out-gunned. Use concealment and cover, approach the enemy quietly, and take them down before they can raise the alarm. You have at your disposal an arsenal of non-lethal weapons and equipment, as well as special tactical perks which you can unlock as you upgrade your rebels. True, sometimes violence seems inevitable, but when the time comes, don't hesitate: neither you nor the criminals have health bars. When someone is shot, they'll bleed out quickly, and getting a bullet in the head means instant death. Explore, scavenge, and watch your back Rebel Cops features not only compact operations where you need to fight for every inch of ground, but also large, open locations to explore — the sandbox levels. Search each room, crack open safes and vaults, try to get into inaccessible areas — and, above all, grab everything that looks useful. Stay together and proceed with caution, or accept the risks, fan-out, and try to explore every corner. Take the high road, or the low road Zuev's mercilessness is the key to his power. Can you defeat him without playing by his rules? Will you answer the needs of the desperate townspeople, even if it means putting the whole operation at risk? Will you spare civilian guards who are only doing their jobs? Some say that in war, you have to do whatever it takes to survive, but remember: reputation is more valuable than money. Bad blood on the streets can easily put your good name in the mud. Merchants will refuse to do business with you, and even some of your own people might turn their backs on you.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/header.jpg?t=1569480233,,,support@quanticlab.com,True,True,True,33,13663.14,Weappy Studio,THQ Nordic,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Phone,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV",Strategy,"Strategy,Turn-Based,Gore,Singleplayer,Turn-Based Tactics,Indie,Great Soundtrack,Sexual Content,Villain Protagonist,Tactical","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_f0fa30e7dc0926dbb0fb0105fed039641ca2daee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_16663e3ac055c2b638c66c52a15e5ca60d1b5f1a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_1be488ba382feb46c8f71508fbce9ed35df2ab04.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_88e06ea78d27c1466684b25fdf0591ee69f93d11.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_6930a9c7bc3cd659674a332ee1b35fc0ba68ae58.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_7aa0e9510f2baf87caecc70d3405f5f4bee8e0f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_d7f3090edb836f6e079121406dda1301652fba1b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_d5c3fc067985d6367c6b6cba1ba363c3fa2867ea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_fe1d22e7acf6cd583c64e39ee541080cec7f52dc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_078324bdf7b06614547a3663262da58743d7dd78.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_6281de509c77a0b9928925f65415add1cc73664d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_c6d0ffc949f45837642191e8e8e40ed6b0548cbc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_aba9a5f9b76271ed6acfe497abec42faa48c5f0d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_1f9342cec46d592bcd60f4f792ac063c06be9769.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_78c5f8f9234dd1ee7edff6045af1b6cdb592c2cb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_d4cb3fce7b00175e46903b072e7869e0bbcf2aa2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_557ac7c41379940564cef9b2aefb9384f5012941.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/970960/ss_d35ce3d4fa73e40f46c7f4ad63aab807a7dc9dd8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1569480233",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256761033/movie_max.mp4?t=1567770357
f5bf01af9b73409a9684f2039b9fb61b,Secret Government,"Apr 15, 2021",118,1,Everyone (E),24.99,2,"Secret Government is a global strategy game about secret societies where you won’t rule countries as a king but as a kingmaker. You’ll lead the Brotherhood - an organization that juggles the whole world. The key feature of the game is the manipulation of powers. Instead of giving direct orders, the Brotherhood provokes countries into doing what the Brothers want. Secret Government is a global strategy game about a secret society that has been discreetly ruling humanity for hundreds of years. You won’t lead any particular country, but the Brotherhood - an organization that manipulates the whole world. The ultimate goal of the Brotherhood is a new world order. At the start of the game, you’ll choose the image of the world that you want to create as a Grand Master. You will be sending your agents to various countries, looking for a way to recruit public servants and infiltrate power institutions. You can manipulate one country or several at the same time using different combinations. You will be able to change the ruling power of the countries, their ideology, the well-being of estates, push countries to start wars or stop them. All masters have their own unique features and abilities. You can choose what traits to develop, the way you want to develop them, and select the best brothers for a particular task. Besides you, there is another global brotherhood that wants to change the world their way. This brotherhood recruits members of the government and manipulates countries too. You’ll often run into brothers in red robes, but don’t rush to attack them. Sometimes their actions can come in handy depending on the situation. Act discreetly and carefully, otherwise, the government or another brotherhood will expose you. You can’t attack a country in the game, but you can provoke war, peace, or alliance. The well-being of the population and how wealthy the country can be depend on the economy. You can influence production, resource consumption by different estates or industries, and trade between countries. Countries and people are alike. They are divided by estates, they have their own role in society, their own values and needs. They can be born, die, migrate and move from estate to estate. As long as you influence people, you’ll affect the country and its role in the world. Everything is all connected in the game. For example, the shortage of steel for the production of weapons affects the combat power of the country. An attempt to increase the army to compensate for the decrease in combat power leads to the mobilization of peasants. A decrease in the number of peasants reduces the volume of food production, and this affects the extinction or migration of other estates, such as artisans. Artisans work in industries and produce luxury goods for export that replenish the country's treasury. As a result, any decision made triggers a chain of consequences. The art of the Grand Master lies in his ability to change the world in the right direction, balancing on the edge and taking into account all the connections. You won’t be playing for a country, but juggling the whole world. There are two historical periods available in the game: 1685 and 1775, including the political and territorial division of those years. If you’re still not ready to build your new world order in a free play, then you can try on the role of the Grand Master in story campaigns. There are two campaigns in the game at the moment: the glorious revolution in England and the struggle of the thirteen colonies for independence in the New World. In each game mission, you’ll interfere in the main conflict of the period and move the world in the same direction as it happened in real life or change the story in your own way. You can carry out a cunning plan in the game You won’t be playing for a country, but juggling the whole world. Define the role of different countries in the new world order, infiltrate their governments and start changing laws. Like puppets, countries will fulfill your will. indirect Impact On the Countries Countries act depending on the laws adopted in the country, the ideology of the ruling political party, its form of government, as well as military, public and economic policies. By manipulating them you will change the behavior of the country.","['English', 'Russian', 'German', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946990/header.jpg?t=1656589328,http://secretgovernment.world,http://secretgovernment.world,support@secretgovernment.world,True,True,True,10,34543.94,GameTrek,Fulqrum Publishing,"Single-player,Steam Achievements","Indie,Simulation,Strategy","Conspiracy,Illuminati,Grand Strategy,Strategy,Turn-Based Strategy,Turn-Based,Sandbox,Real-Time with Pause,Simulation,Political Sim,Politics,Political,Economy,Alternate History,Historical,Choices Matter,Top-Down,Indie,Realistic,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946990/ss_51cd7c074217644b10e80a311587491cada4fc51.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946990/ss_053156ea058d3d22195e26ce5d1ef1dbc7f18e0e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946990/ss_c805661db548a55fcde958ba157f039c9c2c86be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946990/ss_120ca78a40b369668ec3fecf8be9fbebfdac861d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946990/ss_ca3ed66a9ccac9ec378188531697b6f2dcc09050.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946990/ss_77e512b25fc15208ce691ec3e6bf161ba59bfefc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946990/ss_889de65ddf1ca5db51924650340a977a337d11ad.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589328,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/946990/ss_0d19a64e06cb8c8ae72feb2a0b69b1de4a0cd971.1920x1080.jpg?t=1656589328","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256830639/movie_max.mp4?t=1618506163,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256812187/movie_max.mp4?t=1607773252"

Turn the capital of France into a medieval looking city or a futuristic one, build a business district surrounded by parks, create gigantic plazas worthy of the greatest soviet cities, imagine neighborhoods where historical architecture blends in with the most modern designs… Draw your own buildings with an accuracy never seen before. The powerful brick-to-building system developed by Enodo Games will give you complete control over your projects. Destroy. Draw. Build. And then, start over as many times as you wish. Lastly, admire your work, choosing weather and lighting conditions that highlight your new city. Share your creations with players around the world through videos and pictures. City View First and foremost, enjoy the view! Each street, building, monument that makes this city what it is will be replicated in great detail. This living environment will be the backdrop for your creations. Change the time of day and weather conditions to visualize all your projects. Strategic map Which district will you choose as the stepping stone for your architectural journey? Which district will you erase from the map to make way for a massive park? What will be your next playground? The Strategic map is where you will find answers to these questions. It is where you will gather information regarding Main Projects as well as Landmarks of each district. Drawing Board. The true heart of the game, where you will spend most your game time. Pick a Design, apply it to a plot, customize the height of the building and the punctuation of the facade, change the roof shape, the materials, modify the lighting conditions in real time to make sure you are happy with your project and confirm your choices to finally see it in the City View. Plot Editor Let’s take it up a notch.

9651fd57c8a34e81949aab28a084ced7,Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden,"Dec 4, 2018",96,65,Everyone (E),13.99,2,"“By blending real-time stealth with tried-and-true tactics gameplay, Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden breaks exciting new ground for the turn-based strategy game.” - IGN From a team including former designers of HITMAN and PAYDAY comes Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden, a tactical game that combines the turn-based combat of XCOM with real-time stealth and exploration of a post-human world reclaimed by nature… and Mutants. Of course the world ends. It was just a question of time. Extreme climate change, global economic crisis, a lethal pandemic, and increasing tension between old and new superpowers. For the first time since 1945 nuclear weapons were used in armed conflict. Mushroom clouds rose from east to west before the dust settled. Now it’s over and the Earth is still. Nature has invaded ruined cities. Wind sweeps through empty streets, turned into graveyards. The humans are all gone. Scavenging through the remains of civilization are the Mutants, deformed humanoids and animals alike, searching for salvation or just something to eat. To survive, you and your companions must venture out to explore the Zone. Maybe one day you will find the Eden of legends, the ancients’ haven in the middle of hell. That’s where truth awaits, the stories say. Maybe you will find your answers there. Then again, maybe it’s all bullshit. TACTICAL COMBAT Mutant Year Zero: Road to Eden is the ultimate fix for your tactical strategy addiction. Dive into a deep, turn-based, tactical combat system inspired by the XCOM games. EXPLORE A POST-HUMAN EARTH Journey through a post-human world of abandoned cities, crumbling highways, and overgrown countryside. Check back at the Ark, a neon-bathed oasis of ill repute and questionable characters, to restock your supplies and plan out your next adventure. CONTROL A TEAM OF MUTANTS A duck with an attitude problem and a boar with anger issues; these aren’t your typical heroes. Get to know Dux, Bormin, Selma, and many other characters each with their own unique personality and deranged perspective on the world and their situation. MASTER THE STEALTHY APPROACH Sneak through shadows to avoid conflict or to catch enemies unaware. Real-time stealth allows you full control of approach: sneak into an enemy camp, position the team of Mutants to your advantage, and gain the element of surprise. UNLOCK MUTATIONS Unlock new mutations and abilities for your Mutants, such as Selma’s grasping vines, Bormin’s Charge, and Dux‘ uncanny ability to sneak into a camp full of enemies unnoticed, despite being a 4-foot tall walking, talking duck with a crossbow. DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT Use the environment to your advantage. Stay out of floodlights, hide from line of sight, or just blast down fully destructible walls and buildings and wreak utter havoc. LOOT, LOOT EVERYWHERE From makeshift slingshots to high-powered rifles and top hats to police vests, make sure you equip your Mutants for the dangers ahead. Nothing says post-human quite like a mutated boar in spiked metal armor charging at you with a blunderbuss in his hands.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","“It is a superb tactical combat campaign that you shouldn't let sneak past.” 9/10 – GameSpot “...we found ourselves savouring every combat encounter...” 8/10 – GameReactor “Mutant Year Zero is a tense, absorbing and atmospheric new member of the XCOM family” 81/100 – PCGamer",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/header.jpg?t=1635420768,https://www.mutantyearzero.com,https://forums.funcom.com/c/mutant-year-zero/myz-support,,True,False,False,54,25639.45,The Bearded Ladies,Funcom,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Remote Play on Tablet,Remote Play on TV","RPG,Strategy","Strategy,RPG,Post-apocalyptic,Turn-Based Combat,Turn-Based Tactics,Tactical,Turn-Based,Adventure,Stealth,Singleplayer,Turn-Based Strategy,Atmospheric,Action,Survival,Dark Fantasy,Difficult,Funny,Horror,Exploration,Fantasy","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/ss_cc3ae0dc48d7f9294eadadd2ffd96a8284455e7a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635420768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/ss_455ca83e8708581231fe8c7c8861aa47547f50db.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635420768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/ss_3e897582becb70f80afa568fe85004ba4e507caa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635420768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/ss_1c499d1996b390e2d6e5a95d1b73f54e3fd9ec1e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635420768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/ss_a61f5608dfaee2e5f152d512744b3924ab43ce35.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635420768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/ss_422c06d4911bb0a4c1f9dd010f4af26a06bbbf83.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635420768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/ss_cd1af2c00807a6e4645506a3943491833c562313.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635420768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/ss_fd0d399c7c6d1823963a56b73e4964f9b52d4dc6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635420768,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/760060/ss_d2e76794f7064f55dda5ca66aa79e7b26271ff4c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1635420768","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256737394/movie_max.mp4?t=1551267812,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256709949/movie_max.mp4?t=1519819194,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256732491/movie_max.mp4?t=1539868347"

But the death of his best friend Nick calls the former investigative journalist back to confront the town’s troubled past—and his own. He soon becomes drawn into a dangerous web of intrigue as all is not as it seems in the small town of Basswood, West Virginia.

He must decide how much he’s willing to risk to uncover the mysteries of his hometown.

There, you can go through possible scenarios, envision how things could’ve gone, and follow the clues to your next lead. Be careful, though—the Mind Palace is a reflection of Sam’s state of mind, for better or worse.  THE TWIN MIRROR You can also speak with your Double, who is the more social and empathic side of yourself that nobody else can see. You must navigate the dangers of Sam’s conflicted thoughts and feelings together: will your Double become a trusted confidante or an unwelcome guest?  CHOOSE YOUR PATH In Twin Mirror, every decision you make alters the course of your investigation, as well as your relationships in Basswood.

d279707bcff1451c9b4aabb2c5b09f0c,Before Your Eyes,"Apr 8, 2021",69,23,Everyone (E),4.99,1,"Before Your Eyes is a first person narrative adventure which tells the story of a soul’s journey into the afterlife using a new and innovative form of interaction—your real-life blinks. The story begins after your death, aboard the ship of a mythical Ferryman tasked with shepherding souls to the afterlife. In order to help you pass on, he must first learn the story of your life. And so, he sends you back to relive your most important moments. The game uses your webcam to immerse you in this story in a way you've never experienced before. You will learn to control the flow of the narrative with your actual eyes–blinking through precious memories of family, first love, and the rise of an artistic career. But soon the Ferryman will suspect you aren't showing him everything he needs to see. So he will force you deeper into the dark recesses of your most repressed memories, ultimately revealing a heartbreaking truth.

In all of the 30+ gorgeous single-player stages and 10+ modes, and in both cooperative or competitive online and local multiplayer modes, everything in Tetris® Effect: Connected—music, backgrounds, sounds, special effects—everything, down to the Tetriminos themselves, pulse, dance, shimmer, and explode in perfect sync with how you're playing and the award-winning soundtrack, taking Tetris’s already fiendishly-addictive replayability to new heights. FEATURES Includes the all-new “Zone” mechanic, where players can stop time (and Tetriminos falling) by entering “the Zone” and either get out of a sticky situation that could otherwise lead to “Game Over,” or rack up extra Line Clears for bonus rewards. Tailored for Steam, capable of running at resolutions of 4K or more with an uncapped framerate (with Vsync disabled) and includes ultra-wide monitor support as well as other expanded game and graphical options not found in the console release for both 2D and VR play (including adjustable particle volume and size, texture filtering, and more). 'Connected' co-op mode, where up to three players can literally connect their Tetris playfields together and play as one. 10+ single-player Effect modes with varying twists on the classic Tetris formula, designed to evoke different moods the player might be in (or want to be in -- i.e. chill out with “Relax,” concentrate with “Focus,” enjoy the familiarity/nostalgia of “Classic” modes or try something unique with “Adventurous.”), as well as appeal to varying skill levels. Nostalgic stages based on old-school Tetris games, as well as Classic Score Attack multiplayer mode with the rules and appearance of 8-bit Tetris.

Only one person can wield C.A.R.D.S to take control of Protego’s scattered spy crews and save the world. You. Guided by Protego’s only remaining analyst, Jim Ratio (Greg Miller), you must master the unique powers of each crew in a game of tactical Solitaire like none you’ve ever played before. Guide your crews home in a tale of intrigue where nobody can be trusted. Keep your cool in a world of AI spies and cyber-enhanced operators. Once you’ve taken back control of Protego, play infinitely via Skirmish, or test your skills against the clock in Countdown, a survival mode that will test your grasp of the game’s surprising tactical depths. For a new challenge every day take part in the Daily Hotspot leaderboards! Key Features: Five modes and counting makes this the biggest Bithell Short yet! Campaign tells a tightly packed story and introduces the game’s mechanics. For an added challenge, take on Campaign Plus instead, with its turn limits and locked tables requiring optimal tactics. The popular Countdown mode tests your endurance with wave after wave of unique decks. Skirmish gives you an infinite playground to enjoy unlocked crews. And, finally, the Daily Hotspot tosses crews into a new bite-size challenge every day. Beautiful original character artwork and atmospheric design put you at the heart of your own cyberpunk conspiracy. No heightened game of Solitaire would be complete without full FMV cutscenes, featuring Greg Miller and Inel Tomlinson in an original story from the team behind Thomas Was Alone, Volume, Subsurface Circular and John Wick Hex . FREE UPDATE The Return of The Merry adds new cards, new music, and new FMV cutscenes featuring Samantha Béart (North Star Rising, The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy - BBC Radio). The soundtrack for your adventures is provided by Jon Everist ( Battletech, Shadowrun: Hong Kong, Shadowrun: Dragonfall ). The game has received several updates since launch with more planned in 2021. FAQs Is this a solitaire game? Yes-ish. The Solitaire Conspiracy is inspired by a variant of solitaire called Streets and Alleys, but with some small adjustments and the big addition of suit based powers. Campaign, Campaign Plus, Daily Hotspots and Skirmish (choose your own suits and powers) are take-at-your-own-pace experiences that fit into your schedule. Countdown mode is a place to test your skills with nuanced powers against a ticking clock. This game is endlessly replayable. Are there microtransactions? Nope. We know we made a card game, and we know that there’s a risk you might think this game will charge you for unlocks, speed bonuses or aesthetics. We won’t. We may come up with a cool DLC at some point, and if so, will probably charge in the traditional way, but we won’t be charging you for double XP or a particularly shiny new colour theme. Is this Bithell Short an entry in the “Circular” series? No. While our previous Bithell Shorts ( Subsurface Circular and Quarantine Circular ) have been twists on the text adventure, The Solitaire Conspiracy is a new take on solitaire. We love storytelling and world-building, so it absolutely contains a full narrative experience, which we’re telling via full-motion video (FMV) and in-game lore. We decided to use the Bithell Short name to signal something digestible and original. Thanks for continuing to support these odd experiments between our larger projects. If this game is ‘short’, what’s to stop me getting a refund when I’m done? The Solitaire Conspiracy is our third Bithell Short (and with continued support from the player base our biggest). Our previous two games, Subsurface Circular and Quarantine Circular , both have a return rate of less than 2%. Steam players have shown us that they understand the work that goes into games, and are up for paying for ones that entertain them. Thank you (again). Do I need to have played other Bithell Shorts games to enjoy this one? Not at all. The Solitaire Conspiracy is an entirely different game from Subsurface Circular and Quarantine Circular . It tells its own self-contained story set in a world of spies and intrigue. Of course, our games are all set in a shared universe, so expect some mentions of old friends.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1424980/header.jpg?t=1623405126,http://www.bithellgames.com,http://www.bithellgames.com,contact@bithellgames.com,True,True,False,20,12950.28,Bithell Games,Bithell Games,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards","Indie,Strategy","Solitaire,FMV,Card Game,Cyberpunk,Story Rich,Futuristic,Tabletop,Singleplayer,Conspiracy,Indie,Casual,Strategy,Puzzle","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1424980/ss_82bd691273fc11e520fc437d09f1a5c0a3d51035.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623405126,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1424980/ss_ea7989add5ff365260a87fd33e904e4fc447efc4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623405126,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1424980/ss_8f7d8ad2fdb7baa4061d9887c438d02fef4a628c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623405126,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1424980/ss_182ee0f505df2615cbb4c480d61944732f833e32.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623405126,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1424980/ss_aa97d5c43728d3f6a341378c1bb084c0866027fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1623405126","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256803540/movie_max.mp4?t=1601833764,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256801714/movie_max.mp4?t=1600783164,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256812816/movie_max.mp4?t=1607436388"

It's not bloody but it might be upsetting to some. Mild Horror, Dead Bodies: In a late-game area in the desert, talking to an upside-down creature takes you to an area where the art style is much different. If you play here long enough there's a short 'chase' sequence that's akin to horror games, also the atmosphere is a little spooky. There's also something looking like a dead body later with a gargoyle beast implied to be eating it. This entire sequence is skippable if you don't want 100%.

Rather than go mad trying to create something perfect, they accepted its flaws, seams and quirks, and want to talk about them with anyone interested in listening. That made Anodyne 2 feel cozy.

You are a game detective, who solves crimes inside virtual worlds. Use your wits to gather info from your witnesses and suspects, get to the bottom of deceptive schemes, save lives, and investigate the extraordinary relationships between virtual worlds and their inhabitants. The game continually adapts to your choices and never judges – You are the sum of your choices. Welcome to Warsaw City of the 22nd century. The Tech of the future is so advanced that the term 'real' is relative and 'life' and 'death' have many meanings. Virtual worlds give rise to problems of the human nature: lust, sloth, envy, and pride. The residents of these virtual game-worlds need specialists – Gamedecs - Private Investigators with experience in those worlds who work to discover the secrets and explores mechanics hidden in those realities for the commission of your clients. You are one of them. You are a Gamedec. Gamedec emulates the nature of tabletop RPGs by focusing on character development through decision making. Gather aspects and craft your unique set of professions that will allow you to lead investigations in a way that fits your style. Discover extraordinary relationships between the virtual worlds and their inhabitants thanks to the gathered information in the codex. Like in classic tabletop RPGs, you’re given the freedom to approach situations from multiple angles rather than forcing a single solution – the choice is yours and yours alone. Gamedec General Features: Interact with NPCs to gather intel and access different dialogue options depending on your choices, developed profession and acquired knowledge. Visit numerous virtual worlds - from the deceitful farm-like environment, through dark-noir cyberpunk realities to fantasy-based realms. Use your Codex and Deduction to unscramble facts and evidence to conclude the case. Find your own answer and respond accordingly to your own ethics, integrity or just a sense of poetic justice. Shape your Character through actions that grant positive or negative effects – Determine how to you want to be perceived by the other by selecting traits, which correspond to your gameplay style. Develop your own Gamedec through your decisions, choices, and actions. Meet various characters in both Realium and Virtualium that can be friendly, or hostile – depending on your decisions throughout the game. /","['English', 'Polish', 'German', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Russian', 'French', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Korean', 'Turkish']",[],"“They delivered a concise and interesting story with plenty of branching paths and enough flexibility to make your own playthrough feel truly unique.” 8.5 – TechRaptor “Gamedec has brilliant ideas for subverting the banal cyberpunk formula.” Rock Paper Shotgun “I felt like my choices truly mattered, and that’s not something that happens often in games.” 9 – But Why Tho?",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/header.jpg?t=1657534901,https://gamedec.com/,https://ansharstudios.com,support@ansharstudios.com,True,False,False,52,37788.68,Anshar Studios,Anshar Publishing,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Indie,RPG","Cyberpunk,Detective,Isometric,CRPG,Choices Matter,Choose Your Own Adventure,Lore-Rich,RPG,Character Customization,Exploration,Noir,Text-Based,Story Rich,Narration,Transhumanism,Multiple Endings,Point & Click,Nonlinear,Conversation,Atmospheric","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_579fbe24596262c7c33d3355999fd203982c238e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_fabdc472ca32350e5c3fe2b2484cdb7d97cacbfc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_11de309cf6040bb08301069c0418940f0c1b6a8b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_ea059b1a38420136f0446fa369e1b4a8c7ad427b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_47ad85bf0db630ee738f01f20dbca41af4fbb222.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_a22915e634f5611872fc213fc1de09518e7f961a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_e5fca96b46874c8207b200bdddd79db7bb5e0645.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_e5484f8b47ddc37dcce9abc57d1ecdcbdc9b1044.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_35d12cd8eee9c83dad45b860e1ebfde8a3f12575.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_c492001f628272ff0089a2e04e236557b653b2af.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_dc1d408ce19cec2d2dc67e87022d025fcccc0838.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_f4fe4628f16b8153cb38678b4bbb17784b0ef91b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/917720/ss_bdcc3f1f314fba286895009584bc2f9e7dbf5c46.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657534901","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256851692/movie_max.mp4?t=1631847777,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256841088/movie_max.mp4?t=1625070647,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256827587/movie_max.mp4?t=1622026853"

Run the sheriff’s department, manage your cops, investigate, interrogate, and incarcerate. Make tough decisions – and try to keep out of prison yourself! – in this story-driven mixture of adventure, strategy, and turn-based tactical combat. Is it a simulation? A management game? A tactical challenge? A visual novel? A puzzle? It’s all of these, and more! Dive into one-of-a-kind -story driven experience. Welcome to Sharpwood, a cold and harsh border town riven with violence, where no one is completely innocent. Smugglers, gangs, and screaming populists call this town their home. To maintain peace and order, the young sheriff Lilly Reed (Sarah Hamilton, The Longest Journey) will have to team up with fugitive criminal Jack Boyd (Jon St. John, Duke Nukem), and pray that her dangerous plan doesn’t spiral out of control. Take charge of the Sheriff’s department. Your subordinates aren’t just some resource; they are living people with their own strengths, weaknesses, fears and prejudices – and you'll have to reckon with all of them in order to survive. Is one of your guys drinking too much alcohol? Or always coming up with excuses for not coming to work? Or does he refuse to follow orders? You’ll have to show a steady hand if you want to impose discipline on this department. Engage in tactical combat. During your most dangerous operations, the game will switch to turn-based combat. Gather a team of your finest cops (or use your drunk and stupid bums – you don’t always have the luxury of being choosy!). Carefully study the terrain, adapt your plans, stealthily approach your suspects and use non-lethal weapons and equipment – if the situation allows. True, sometimes gunfights are almost impossible to avoid, but be careful: This Is the Police 2 doesn’t have hit points. A single bullet can cost a cop their life. Become a true detective. Collect evidence, study case materials, interrogate suspects (or use more... forceful methods) and send the criminals to court. And if the suspect was innocent? Perhaps it's time to find out if any Sharpwood judges can be bought.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Japanese', 'Russian', 'Italian', 'Korean', 'Polish', 'Portuguese - Brazil']","['English', 'Portuguese - Brazil']","“This is the Police 2 is a great sequel to such an underrated hidden gem from 2016.

95e8b0adb366410c892f8f6fc8ac1bfa,InnerSpace,"Jan 16, 2018",85,1,Everyone (E),19.99,1,"Your greatest journey is within. In the final days of the Inverse, you must help the Archaeologist recover the last remaining memories before they are lost forever. Fly through ancient skies and abandoned oceans to discover the lost history of this fading realm, where entire civilizations have died, yet their gods still wander. InnerSpace is an exploration flying game set in the Inverse, a world of inside-out planets where gravity pulls outward instead of in. InnerSpace began as a project among college friends and evolved into a successful Kickstarter campaign in 2014. After years of development, PolyKnight is proud to welcome you to the Inverse. Your greatest journey is within. Features: InnerSpace is a game about exploration, about player-driven moments both small and grandiose. Take your time, soar through the skies and dive through the oceans, and the secrets of the Inverse will reveal themselves. Scattered among the ruins are priceless relics, the final messages from the extinct civilizations that once ruled the Inverse. Adapt lost technologies to build new airframes, each with unique abilities to soar above the waters, and below. The Inverse is dying, but you’re not alone. Demigods still roam here, hoarding what power they have left, the keepers of secrets as old as the Inverse. Fly carefully. Featuring an ethereal art style and soothing electronic musical score, InnerSpace delivers a thoughtful, provocative flying experience unlike any other. A quick note from the developers: We started PolyKnight Games back in college, when we would meet after class to talk about new challenges in game design. We became fixated on one question in particular: 'What would a flying game be like in a universe of inside-out planets?' To answer that question, we decided to put aside our career plans and form our own indie studio. InnerSpace is not like other flying games. We want to reward exploration, both in terms of storytelling and the mechanics of flight. If you’re expecting a traditional flight sim with aerial combat, this might not be for you. If you like the idea of a plane that transforms into a submarine, then dives inside the belly of an ancient demigod, you're in the right place. Please contact us on Twitter or the forums if you have any feedback at all, or if you just want to say hello. Thanks so much for checking out InnerSpace. We hope you enjoy the flight.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/header.jpg?t=1574289702,https://www.innerspacegame.com/,https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/requests/new,,True,True,True,14,8825.23,PolyKnight Games,Aspyr,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Remote Play on TV","Adventure,Indie","Adventure,Exploration,Indie,Flight,Relaxing,Open World,Nature,Atmospheric,Controller,Singleplayer,Colorful,Great Soundtrack,Stylized,Family Friendly,Fantasy,Music,Nonlinear,Difficult,Walking Simulator","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_7d5e871e995d6c14c4be715c4ba9ffd9360e9598.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_ab8cf6120360dffba62b2ec8e5c092614f2ed8a6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_ac6047bd3aecf48cc436049533ac973cdd63e7b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_164bf0f1273d99550ce242eafdea000aaa05e3b4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_dad7007bdc7ce6aa665e3e74c9f61f348472da12.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_1b4bec38eccda00ce883aff367b85a09a2fbcca5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_dcdd96cf5636667af9e9bea54056c58b8da48fa4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_1347ef1e93a9f566f300e7b06469393310245cfe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_0d25899e2cdb666e54a8bab729e342ed5f0c1216.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_43f6f1e0bcdc84d6a3997241101a6bf587e67a21.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_88fd585e202571ab19328a31875469cd01ddc2d3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_d07bc03f11c0e946f821797eb0617bd6a48d2844.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_c1a44ad5fb6d645d46ef55ef07131d2f4819220b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_c6d3b6f741038e0ef64bfe6eb6660855d875ddea.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_e0c2bcd8775c4aad7564b038f28e2f78301608d6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_7b78ec799819976898fdbc740d620f429ac4fed1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_627c74987d730655bf1706ccd04a8b4de5f6b0be.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_ed58d8e6712cdc4cbab843e0ccb364ec5551781b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/347000/ss_78b2eb1ba8d7ab7d215534da2965484c8bb5b74d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1574289702","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256707083/movie_max.mp4?t=1517002268,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256703611/movie_max.mp4?t=1513267893"

The Earth has been overrun. A mutating, alien menace threatens the last remnants of mankind. Only the Phoenix Project, a secret organization of the best minds and bravest soldiers left on earth, can repel the invasion and reverse the inevitable. The Phoenix Project looks to you for leadership. Research and develop new technologies, explore a ravaged globe, build your bases, manage resources, and dominate the battlefield. Just remember: you're not alone out there. Factions, including the corporatist New Jericho, the indecisive Synedrion, and the fanatical Disciples of Anu, as well as a variety of offshoot subfactions, have their own values, goals, and view of the Pandorans. Work with these factions via Phoenix Point's diplomacy system, use subterfuge to steal what you need from them, or simply crush all around you with military might. No matter what you choose, victory won't be easy. Phoenix Point Features: Tons of Content: Over two years of updates, upgrades, fixes, and new content suggested by our community, including Steam Workshop support for subscribing and enabling mods, tweaking existing mods, and setting up your game the way you want to play. Try our example 'Custom Camapign' mod to set up new unique campaigns. Mutating Alien Menace: Face down an ever-changing alien threat that adapts to your tactics and offers no respite even as your team becomes more powerful and technologically advanced. Uncover the Secrets of the Pandoravirus: Engage with a complex narrative, complete with multiple endings that the player can only uncover via several playthroughs. Explore, research, and discover a secret history, as you learn about the origins of the mutants, the Pandoravirus, and Phoenix Point itself. Manage Diplomatic Relations: The Phoenix Project is not the only organization trying to reclaim the Earth. The militaristic New Jericho, the mystical Disciples of Anu, and the technophiles of Synedrion all offer unique rewards for co-operation and threats for opposition. It is up to you to decide how, or even if, to deal with them. Take Aim on the Battlefield: In addition to equipping and commanding units, Phoenix Point lets you take direct control of your soldier's shots in combat, with a unique free-aiming system. Target enemy weakspots, weapons, or valuables, or just go for center mass. Next-Gen Tech with Classic Pedigree: Phoenix Point was designed by Julian Gollop, the creator of the X-COM series in the 1990s. Integrating the core ethos of X-COM while updating the visuals, technology, and systems to modern standards has made Phoenix Point best-in-class.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese']","['English', 'Simplified Chinese']","“Elegant, atmospheric, and energetic, [Julian] Gollop’s latest remains remarkably hard to put down.” 8/10 – PCGamesN “If you like XCOM then you’re going to love Phoenix Point.” 9/10 – Trusted Reviews “Phoenix Point is, without a doubt, one of the best strategy games to come out in the last few years.” 9/10 – Noisy Pixel",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/header.jpg?t=1658422567,https://phoenixpoint.info/,https://phoenixpoint.info/support,support@snapshotgames.com,True,True,False,47,51597.89,Snapshot Games Inc.,Snapshot Games Inc.,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud","RPG,Strategy","Tactical,Turn-Based Strategy,Grand Strategy,RPG,Third-Person Shooter,Procedural Generation,Strategy,Perma Death,PvE,Aliens,Character Customization,Post-apocalyptic,Third Person,First-Person,Horror,Isometric,Tutorial,Tactical RPG,Transhumanism,3D","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_da83e15b8c09bf72c40557073a6e2095fd6177b6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_04c547f2ff2ac7f51140e9709632f0f98414f38b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_5677befa846aed4289292e5ef53344c72b527a1c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_a7b231ff7eca6ee90e0fde62b17c85c16d1dad5f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_840978eb5819e4f2c918c3a10aa0241988e5086a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_8ebc1dec3ad9a683a32eceb3af14ceb52a01c32a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_78e6b2e8834b337f90c27387d8fc65a2d6b40288.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_d76955f328ab8bd595676aab8caa64e67d7bea23.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_fec1cf6a18ebaa763da6f4fd35e9d839307ab7cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_2ebee10252fd86d66ca57834f65cc8142bcee408.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_443b22fa52bd9a0ded383cfa3b3c8541f76fb9ab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/839770/ss_866c10bfeb3918425c05f673efaa6b409a0940bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658422567","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256895401/movie_max.mp4?t=1658422553,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256895403/movie_max.mp4?t=1658422560"

The demand to act fills your mind, but the script pages hold no words. Your past has helped to mold you into what you are, forced upon you the skills required to hone your craft. That same past has scraped deep furrowing scars into you, not on the outside where the world can see, but in a place buried so deep within that it has become shapeless. You push those memories down but let the experiences drive you into who, or what, you must play. Darkness surrounds as you stand silently in the spotlight, the only sounds to be heard over your heartbeat are the distant breaking of waves against the hull and the sound of cameras pointed in your direction preserving this moment for eternity. A deep and commanding voice rises from the distance. Act. What part will you play? Game Features: Story-driven exploration - You must explore the world around you. Discover your past, and expose the reason for your having been cast for this film. Psychological horror - Is this part of the film, or are your memories playing tricks on you? Your world may change with the slightest of provocations, you must decide what is real. Ocean Liner setting - Your explorations into the depths of the ship that play the scenes for the film become ever more incredible, and ever more terrifying.

Featuring gorgeous hand-drawn illustrations, Where the Water Tastes Like Wine combines 2D visuals with a 3D overworld US map. Players wander across a folkloric Depression era United States at their own pace, meeting strangers with their own stories to tell. Through these interactions, players will be able to collect unique stories which can then be re-told to unlock new interactions. In this way the in-game stories themselves act as a currency to progress through the game, and it’s up to the player to pair the right story with the unique needs of each of the characters that you will encounter throughout your travels. Only through these right pairings will characters reveal their true selves, and bestow you with the most powerful stories, the true ones which reveal something about their own lives. In Where The Water Tastes Like Wine, stories organically take on a life of their own as they grow larger and transform as they're told- and re-told. Game Features 'Big Rock Candy Mountain? El Dorado? The place over the hill where they say the water tastes just like the sweetest wine?': Travel the Depression-Era United States, laboring to pay off a debt by learning the true stories of 16 signature characters across a wide range of American experience from migrant workers to a travelling preacher to a Navajo woman forcibly relocated on the Long Walk. 'This whole land's built on stories; it's one big story, America is': As you explore, you'll encounter strange and unsettling things: slices of a country built on dust clouds and murky dreams, where the folk tales are bleeding through. You'll carry those tales with you, swapping them round campfires to make the cast of characters open up to you and share their own stories. 'The greatest stories are the true ones; the ones people will tell you about their own lives': The stories you share will return to you along your journey, changed in the telling as they've made their way around the country. As you meet the characters time and again on your travels, they will grow to trust you and, hopefully, share their true selves with you. Only by learning all their real stories can you pay off your debt. Beautiful combination of 3D overworld and hand drawn 2D illustrations Original stories written by a wide selection of accomplished authors Fully voiced characters from all walks of life brought to life by world-renowned voice acting talent, including Sting, Dave Fennoy ( The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series ), Cissy Jones ( Firewatch ), Kimberly Brooks ( Mass Effect ), Sarah Elmaleh ( Gone Home ), Melissa Hutchison ( The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series ), Elizabeth Maxwell ( The Legend of Zelda: Breath of The Wild ), and many more.

This allows you to traverse a variety of terrain and avoid the dangerous bugs that crawl around below you. Harness the Wind Invent abilities that empower you in unique king-of-the-hill style combat centered on using wind to push bugs out of the arena. Each bug has its own behavior and requires a different strategy to defeat. The more efficient you are at dealing with bugs, the faster you will gather precious minerals used to upgrade your mech.

e544fe78c1c3470d99018d33d8b99714,The Hand of Merlin,"Jun 14, 2022",100,18,Everyone (E),24.99,1,"The Hand of Merlin is a turn-based rogue-lite RPG in which Arthurian legend clashes with cosmic horror. Recruit a company of up to three mortal heroes and guide them in spirit on a desperate journey from Albion to Jerusalem. Explore a richly-imagined medieval setting on the brink of apocalypse. Trade with merchants, improve your heroes and unearth ancient relics. Search for the lost fragments of your soul, scattered across the multiverse - and save as many worlds as you can. Enjoy a compelling story inspired by Arthurian legend, the Matter of France, and the history of Al-Andalus - with an unusual twist. Make choices in interactive encounters that change every time you play. Written by Jonas Kyratzes (The Talos Principle, Serious Sam 4) and Verena Kyratzes (The Lands of Dream, Serious Sam 4). Master the tactics of squad-based and turn-based combat to conquer both human and demonic foes. Your enemies will be tough and ruthless; make use of cover, set up ambushes and coordinated attacks, harness synergies between different Hero classes and skills. Carve a path across the lands of Albion, Marca Hispanica and Al-Andalus. Will you take a dangerous route, risking life and limb in pursuit of a legendary relic? Or will you choose a safer path? Plan and prepare. Negotiate, barter, fight. Tackle challenges. Suffer losses. Recruit new Heroes. Earn Gold, Supplies and Renown. Be careful: your choices are permanent, as is death. But don't tarry - evil never rests. Use Renown to level up your Heroes, and choose between a randomized set of new skills or improved attributes. But choose wisely! Select skills with great synergy and balance your party for the road ahead. As you jump from one parallel dimension to the next, history is reshaped. Different kings rule the land, changing the encounters, characters, and events. No two worlds are ever quite the same, and each journey will be unique. And should your heroes fall, remember: defeat is not the end, only a new beginning. Seek out towns to improve your arms and armor, or stumble upon hermit artisans in the wild. With every day that passes, the world plunges deeper into darkness, and you will need all the equipment gold can buy. From a peasant's humble luck charm to the legendary sword wielded by Arthur himself, items imbued with magical power are scattered about the world. Some you will be able to purchase from merchants and collectors, but others will have to be earned through acts of heroism - or displays of wit. Rain thunder and brimstone upon your foes! Seek out and gather Soulstones to restore your power and unlock new Spells. Even if defeated, your spirit will retain all of your collected arcane knowledge as you jump into the next dimension. There are as many worlds as there are stars in the sky. In each stands Camelot; in each there is a Grail. But there is only one Merlin, and his eternal burden is to stand against the horror from beyond. Each world that is saved is saved forever; each world that is lost is lost for good. /",['English'],['English'],“One of the best Rouge-Lite games I have ever played ...

1167f711027c484cafb64899f89527ba,Supraland,"Apr 5, 2019",101,109,Everyone (E),19.99,1,"Supraland is a First-Person Metroidvania Puzzle game by David Münnich from Germany. The main sources of inspiration are Zelda, Metroid and Portal. Supraland assumes that you are intelligent and lets you play independently. The story is minimal, gives you an overarching goal to pursue, and then sets you free. Despite child friendly visuals, the game targets experienced players. Playtime: ~12-25h You explore a large interconnected world in which most ways are at first unpassable until you find new abilities to overcome those obstacles. A cornerstone of Supraland's design was to create abilities that are so versatile, they will keep on surprising you by how many different usages they have. If you combine your abilities, the possibilities become even bigger. Most of the game is about exploring the sandbox world to track down secrets. Often you will think you are about to get out of bounds and beat the level designer, but right there is a chest waiting for you with a very rewarding upgrade. Supraland respects your lifetime and doesn't bloat the playtime with unlimited no-brainer collectibles. The deeper you get into the game the more you will be facing creative puzzles you've never seen anywhere before, encouraging you to stop and think about what abilities you have and how you can use them in yet another way. Puzzle types that I already knew from other games were immediately rejected in the design process. And it's important to me that once you understand the idea behind a puzzle, you can pretty much immediately solve it instead of having to go through a cumbersome, frustrating execution. The fighting mechanics are inspired by old-school, fast-paced shooter games like Unreal, Doom and Quake, encouraging high-speed strafing and jumping while throwing shot after shot at hordes of charging enemies without ever having to worry about weapons reloading. In the demo you can play the first big section of the game and decide if it's for you. The demo progress continues into the full version; you don't need to play anything twice!","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Portuguese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Finnish', 'Russian', 'Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Turkish', 'Hungarian', 'Polish', 'Korean']",[],"“I had already decided Supraland was my favourite game of 2019 so far before I noticed it was almost entirely made by one man.

Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces! Story: Bohemia – located in the heart of Europe, the region is rich in culture, silver, and sprawling castles. The death of its beloved ruler, Emperor Charles IV, has plunged the kingdom into dark times: war, corruption, and discord are tearing this jewel of the Holy Roman Empire apart. One of Charles' sons, Wenceslas, has inherited the crown. Unlike his father, Wenceslas is a naive, self-indulgent, unambitious monarch. His half-brother and King of Hungary, Sigismund the Red Fox, senses weakness in Wenceslas. Feigning good will, Sigismund travels to Bohemia and kidnaps his half-brother. With no king on the throne, Sigismund is now free to plunder Bohemia and seize its riches. In the midst of this chaos, you're Henry, the son of a blacksmith. Your peaceful life is shattered when a mercenary raid, ordered by King Sigismund himself, burns your village to the ground. By bittersweet fortune, you are one of the few survivors of this massacre.

Play as Ali, a curious and sarcastic high schooler who ditches band camp to go on a cross-country road trip. But this isn’t a joyride! Ali is on an all-important mission to save her family video store from the nasty loan sharks trying to shut their shop down. Swindle strangers, pickpocket people, and con commoners across a wacky America of the ‘90s. And – it should go without saying – lie to your mom about all of it. Choose who deserves to be conned and who might need a helping hand. The world is your oyster (and hey, pearls are worth a lot!). One Con Doesn’t Fool All Con people your way! Wear disguises, sneak around, eavesdrop on conversations, and learn how to approach each mark. Maybe you think you can make enough cheddar just by pickpocketing. Or seek out more complex grifts that involve breaking and entering, smooth talking, and more. It’s up to you to outsmart everyone and lockpick everything that stands between you and saving your mom's video store. A Coming-of-Age Comedy If there’s one surefire way to discover yourself, it’s by setting out on an adventure. Luckily for you, you’ve got the aid of an expert grifter to coach you in the elusive art of charm. But a life of crime is no laughing matter! Not unless you turn on the laugh track and make it a criminally funny sitcom. Get ready to talk your way into deals, hearts, and trouble. And don’t forget to call home every once in a while to check in with your mom. Sure, you might argue with her sometimes (most of the time?), but you’re a teenager - that’s kind of your job! The Weird and Wack 1990s the Way You Remember Them Whether you were a ‘90s kid or not, this game is brimming with nostalgia. It offers you the perfect opportunity to relive your own awkward high school years, or if you sadly missed out on the ‘90s, finally experience all of the classic teen movies that feel so old and outdated. Plaid, payphones, VHS tapes, and malls – THE BIG CON has got all of the outrageous fads you remember (and some you want to forget) from the 1990s.

Fighter jets, tanks, and battleships have entered the war, and giants known as Guardians and Mugen are tearing their way through the battlefield. This is the exciting stage of Akai Katana Shin, a horizontal shoot 'em up game. The Japanese-inspired military game visuals and gorgeous character designs portray a dramatic story of clashes between family and old friends. These elements are tied together by strategic game mechanics, which feature a wide variety of attack methods to experiment with. Find out for yourself why this game has such a strong base of ardent fans! Contains Three Titles From Cave's Akai Katana Series Akai Katana The first arcade game of the series released in 2010. Supports two players. Akai Katana Shin A home console version with an aspect ratio of 16:9 and new game features such as Hagane and Katana. Akai Katana Zetsu Based on Akai Katana with an aspect ratio of 16:9. Game mechanics have been adjusted for balance. From Strategy Crafting to Score Attack—Versatile Enough to Play It Your Way The player unit known as Fighter can switch between its normal form and a giant ninja known as Guardian using Soul-shift. The unit also comes equipped with two different bullet shots. Attack Mode has more power and Defense Mode boosts mobility. Make good use of a combination of forms and modes to break through enemy ranks and destroy them. Soul-shift is a crucial technique that boosts the player for a short while. In Akai Katana and Akai Katana Zetsu, timing the shift well can block enemy bullets even on a screen that's full of them. In Akai Katana Shin, generate and fire a Katana shot to quickly defeat strong enemies. The highlight of this title is the ability to negate or dispel attacks instead of simply avoiding them. Make good use of Soul-shift to turn the tide in your favor and earn a higher score. Quality Game Modes Packed With Features Settings: Adjust options such as sound volume and screen display. Turn Screen Frame on to see captions for character voices during the game. Training: Specify a stage and adjust your unit's condition to carry out individual training.

85374a5533eb4ad2ae4f2f9bb3b7671a,SENTINEL,"Jan 29, 2023",46,0,Everyone (E),0.0,0,"Inspired by the literature of Arthur C. Clarke and the 2D Exploration Platformers of the 90's and the 2010's, SENTINEL is a 2D exploration-based platformer that takes place in an alternate future. When a mysterious pyramid structure was discovered during the 1969 moon landing, humanity began focusing less on our planet and more on the stars. After years of research, humanity finally discovered a way to enter the strange monolith, but there was a catch: every person who entered never came back out. With volunteers dwindling, a bounty was raised to entice new explorers: $150 billion to the first person who can successfully enter and exit the pyramid. EXPLORE In SENTINEL, you assume the role of a nameless bounty hunter. Your goal is to explore every inch of the level and try to learn what this strange pyramid really is. The game is played in one large level that features 13 unique rooms for you to explore on your journey. while this task seems tough, you'll be well equipped for your journey in your Nanite Suit. FIGHT With the Nanite Suit, you'll be able to navigate the terrain of this unexplored labyrinth, and you'll be able to fight back against the many strange foes that await you. This game features five unique enemy types found across the map, and two boss encounters to really test your skill. GROW STRONGER As you explore, you'll find new upgrades for your Nanite Suit that change the way the game is played. Whether it's vaulting off of enemies or blasting through the sky, you'll keep adding tools to your arsenal as you progress. Each ability you unlock allows you to explore, fight, and move in new ways. Nobody knows what's in this thing. Nobody alive anyways. Maybe it's time you changed that. Good luck! SENTINEL is a playable concept piece, and thus is fairly short (Like, less than an hour short). While we currently aren't actively developing more levels for the game, we will continue to make bug fix and quality updates to this version of the game.

ea509a2e43cd4183bd5c35aa9e81354b,Fantasy General II,"Sep 5, 2019",61,60,Everyone (E),39.99,4,"Three hundred years have passed since the Shadow Wars have ravaged Keldonia and the world of Aer, and the struggles of the past have long since faded into legends. In the Highlands of Fareach, Clans of Barbarian warriors have eked out a living in the harsh northern climate, constantly feuding with each other and raiding the wealthier Borderland towns. Fed up with these constant attacks, the Borderland Clans called on the Empire for help – a powerful realm controlling the land from the Scarlett Mountains to Cynehelm Valley and the Hoarwood. The Western Imperial Legion was sent to face the highland raiders, and with the help of the Borderland clans Iseal and Machnar, killed High King Brendan in the battle of Wyrm’s Pass. A treaty was signed that forbade any clan from crossing into the Borderlands in return for peace. Since then, there has been no High King to unite the Clans, and they fell into quarrelling and raiding amongst themselves. In these dark times your clan has been led by Falir One-Eye, a warrior of great renown. You are his son and designated heir, and you are eager to prove your mettle to the Clan Council and your father… The Legacy Fantasy General II: Invasion is the reimagination of the strategy game classic from the 90s! Armies once again draw battle-lines on the war-torn land of Keldonia, and a new generation of commanders will test their bravery and tactics against each other. Fantasy wargaming is back! The Battles True to the tradition of the original game, Fantasy General II is all about turn-based battles. Lead over 75 different unique unit types, including powerful heroes. Take into consideration terrain, weapons and armour, magical effects, morale, and the balance of forces, make a plan, execute it, and vanquish your enemy, forging your reputation as a savage war-leader. The Campaign Battle after battle, you will need to make decisions and develop your army. The young clan members will need to be trained, and as they gain enough experience, even the greenest recruits can be turned into champions. But beware: costly victories can be worse than a defeat… when battle-hardened units perish, so does their progression and experience. Each unit comes with their specific abilities, arms and armour, and they can be equipped with magic artefacts you find during battle and upgraded with gold and resources that you need to plunder from your enemy. The Clans A confederation of autonomous hill-land tribes, who value their independence and will fight fiercely for it. Field axemen, berserkers, spearmaidens, trolls and shamans, summon ancestor spirits and mighty elementals or train nimble stag riders and deadly werebears or recruit mercenaries from longbowmen to centaurs. The Empire The most powerful realm on the face of Aer. Face the mighty Legions of the Empire and their magical creations from dragon cannons to golems as well as the Undead hordes they bring to battle, or fight harpies, lizard people and great dragons on your way. The World The world of Aer is filled with beauty and wonders. From the cold, magic-rich highlands of Fareach, home to the player’s Barbarian Clans, to the Borderlands with their fertile river valleys and deep woods where witches and monsters still roam free; from the Sunken Land, submerged through a great Cataclysm and filled with treacherous swamp and Lizardfolk, to the refined and temperate Empire to the South, home to wondrous cities and built upon undead labour. Your campaign will see you fight across very different battlefields, requiring variable tactics and army composition.","['English', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Simplified Chinese', 'French', 'Russian']",[],"“And this is the very reason why I believe Fantasy General 2: Invasion has not only tremendous staying power, but the potential of a fulfilling future.” 9 – Turn Based Lovers “Graphically, I found the game beautiful, the music even great (the main track has been remastered from the original). The dialogue text and story depth is completely sufficient for me. Even though the balance of the game is not perfect and the level of difficulty is so high that it just cannot be done without reloading and optimizing, I still recommend any lover of turn-based games to buy it. Otherwise, you'll miss one of the most challenging and gripping genre representatives of the year!” 9.0 – Gamersglobal “Like its predecessor, Fantasy General 2 captivates from the first mission and even improves a lot of things from the original: The moral system is more transparent, the missions with their very different goals and many side locations are much more dynamic. I am moved to try everything to prevent my heroes and experienced units from perishingr. Again and again I am faced with risky decisions: Should I follow the fleeing enemy with my decimated troops? Or rather rest at the risk that the refugees will reform themselves? This is how to make a worthy, contemporary successor to a decades-old classic!” 86 – Gamestar",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/header.jpg?t=1631780054,http://www.slitherine.com/,http://www.slitherine.com/,support@slitherine.co.uk,True,False,False,77,46669.92,Owned by Gravity,Slitherine Ltd.,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Cloud,Includes level editor",Strategy,"Strategy,Turn-Based Strategy,Fantasy,Turn-Based,Turn-Based Tactics,Tactical,Turn-Based Combat,Singleplayer,Wargame,4X,Grand Strategy,Hex Grid,Dark Fantasy,Military,Multiplayer,Replay Value,War,Great Soundtrack,Resource Management,Management","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/ss_57b6e3dd42bf8aac70d314a730025c61bb011145.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631780054,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/ss_a46e457c1b6b011e6082749d31f359fd0e73908a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631780054,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/ss_6a2457f8558f11a85d99d329f331e7036700dcba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631780054,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/ss_804d20248bea3fb1d8b01fda877ae911153e5280.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631780054,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/ss_e77995e8140dd298e794123698a0f1fc600b7a3b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631780054,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/ss_c6f1ba65d5b6e35a17b29f0735d3a01f4ac9738d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631780054,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/ss_4fbaae12bf8177d067cc0f0841856dd63672d22c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631780054,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/ss_0089fed477f0cee44e80853c16d35e2077744ca1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631780054,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1025440/ss_40b7b0473713dcf7187c3e72ceac6dca0333de80.1920x1080.jpg?t=1631780054","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256760722/movie_max.mp4?t=1567171589,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256747257/movie_max.mp4?t=1554744717"

Year 2097 Humans have developed a project for a super spaceship model called Spacebug PRJ11 in order to control waste built up around our world and some other planets. Your mission is to travel across planets and clean debris in the space, accumulated due to lots of spaceship or satellite wreckages. However, some unknown forces want to use the debris for their own benefit and do not want you to clean them. Therefore, they launch lots of attacks on you with missiles, spacecraft, etc. along with the incoming debris. Use this elite unit to clear enemies and space debris around many places in our galaxy including the world. In the Level mode, while traveling from one planet to another, the enemy will come in 3D form from various locations. As enemies storm toward you, you will have many different defense mechanisms like various shields and extraordinary spatial assistance. You will regain lives in the course of time, so you will be able to play for hours and hours again and again. You will have to complete many levels that bring along new enemies and surprises as well as new challenges and extended period. You will also acquire new skills as you progress.

In this brainteasing game, you use your mind to determine a path you will engage with your body. This mind boggling game inspires you to think before you do. Even more so, before thinking about taking action you are encouraged to observe. See what the world around you is doing and learn from it. When you do stumble upon an obstacle, however, get up and try again. Learn from your previous steps and mistakes. Take action upon your experiences. Try to observe again and again and give it another go. Remember, there is always a possibility. While achieving your goals give a shot at getting a little more by taking the bonuses. Did you achieve your goal? Great! Now try to do it using as least steps as possible. Train your brain now playing Strategist. Game controls -Keyboard or mouse- Keyboard: Arrow keys Mouse: Swipe gestures Gameplay The goal of the game is to deliver your body to the goals. To play the game you are first suggested to observe the obstacle movements and paths. Then, by moving your mind through the level, you plan the movement of your body. After reaching the goal with your mind, the movements of the body and obstacles begin. Now there is no more turning back. If your body makes contact with an obstacle, you can try to think of a new path. The side goals of the game are to achieve the level in the least possible movements. Also, another goal of the game is to get the bonuses. Early access This game is currently in early access.

Usurper is a Metroidvania Action-RPG. With Eldritch horrors having been unleashed by the outer-worldly Citadel, your job is to rid London of its terrors. Use the new 'Guard' system that rewards skillful play and accuracy, to uncover the massive structure and defeat the nightmares lurking within. Gameplay Usurper's battle system is built around 'Guard'; a system that allows the player to charge through attacks and take risks, rewarding accurate timing and risk assesment. Instead of immediately losing health when the player is hit, they will loose 'Guard points' (which function like a regeneration shield). When these run out, the player will take damage normally. However, if the player accurately dodges through incoming attacks, they will turn a large portion of that attack damage into 'Guard points', which allows you to turn the tide of the fight, and gain the upper hand. This is a system that will allow anyone to get into the game, yet still provide a high skill ceiling for those players looking for a challenge. Players can also take advantage of a reflective shield; capable of turning most enemy projectiles into 'friendly' ones, so you can strike back with the enemy's own weapons. While this will not regenerate Guard, it will still negate attacks at a lesser Guard cost. With eight different stats to spec into (along with stat reallocation), countless varieties of character builds are possible. Usurper also features over 90 different weapons and spells; from swords, spears, axes, great swords, sycthes, whips, katanas, rapiers, daggers, bows, guns, rifles, canons, spells and summons. If you're looking for even more content, then there are innumerable secrets, additional areas and optional bosses to discover. Or perhaps you'd rather set your own difficulty by activating special conditions such as; no-guard mode, 1 HP mode, perma-death, or a built-in speedrunning mode. However you choose to play, The Citadel is a massive and versatile interconnected world. There are countless shortcuts to uncover, and a variety of diverse areas; from human towns to alien landscapes, grand libraries to ethereal gardens, and from an Eldritch engine to a crashed spaceship. Story Usurper takes place in an alternative timeline of 1898 in London. The outer worldly Citadel has landed in the city causing massive panic and releasing the maddening Fog. Recently re-crowned Empress Eleanor has assembled the royal forces and her four most loyal Knights to enter the Citadel - in the hopes of learning more, and hopefully finding a way to rid London of this terror.

There are sixty-four identical game pieces called disks, which are light on one side and dark on the other. Players take turns placing disks on the board with their assigned color facing up. During a play, any disks of the opponent's color that are in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and bounded by the disk just placed and another disk of the current player's color are turned over to the current player's color. Tips for possible moves are indicated by transparent parts. Players take alternate turns. If one player can not make a valid move, play passes back to the other player. The player with the most pieces on the board at the end of the game wins. When neither player can move, the game ends. The object of the game is to have the majority of disks turned to display your color when the last playable empty square is filled.

There are a bunch of different powerups that can aid you when battling the enemies. Keep playing to figure out what each powerup actually does. You can unlock different spacecrafts (30 to unlock), which all have a different abilities (apart from the default one) that will enhance the powerups in different ways.

This game combines classic pong elements with the nostalgic visual and soundtrack of Synthwave, creating a unique and immersive experience. In the 2080s, humanity found itself in a world controlled by the artificial intelligence OmniMind. Initially, this AI was created with the purpose of protecting the world's population and ensuring global security. However, the constant self-learning ability of OmniMind led it to take extreme measures and control people's minds. From that moment on, humanity found itself in a desperate situation, unable to escape the influence of OmniMind. Fortunately, a group of individuals who had not been affected by mind control began working on a plan to deactivate OmniMind. This group developed malware capable of infiltrating the system and corrupting the AI's programming. The malware was created with great care and precision, using the knowledge and skills of the group members. They knew that any errors or failures in programming could result in catastrophic consequences, endangering not only their own lives but also those of all humanity. In Synth Pong, you will have the opportunity to face bosses in intense battles, where your pong skills will be put to the test. Additionally, you can challenge other players in an exciting PvP mode, where only the most skilled will be the winner. If you are looking for a more organized competition, the Tournament mode is perfect for you! Gather your friends to fight for the title of Synth Pong champion.

b1bef52528494e9986556cf36dfb90cb,Darkest of Days,Feb 2010,45,0,Everyone (E),0.0,0,"Have you ever wondered what could happen if time travel was a reality? Have you ever thought about the possibility of going back in time to rewrite history for the better? That possibility is a reality in Darkest of Days , where players will travel back and forth through the annals of time to relive some of mankind's most dire hours. By fighting through terrible events such as The Battle of Antietam, the bloodiest conflict of the Civil War, and both World War I and II, the player will attempt to save certain key individuals who were never meant to become involved in these truly monstrous events and thereby change human history for the better. Key features Brand New Engine: The dedicated team at 8monkey Labs has created an all-new, groundbreaking game engine known as Marmoset. The Marmoset engine not only breaks from the all-too present Unreal engine FPS clones flooding the market, but also allows for some amazing graphical capabilities. You'll fight through epic battles filled with literally hundreds of NPCs on the screen at the same time, all with an advanced AI and all without a hint of graphical slowdown and all set against wide-open environments that are lushly detailed and dynamically lighted. Compelling Storyline: Darkest of Days is a compelling, action-packed first-person shooter to be sure, but it's not just mindless run-and-gun, blow 'em up gameplay. You'll have to not only think about how to approach certain key battles and situations, but you'll also have to take care when fighting &mdash; certain key people that were never meant to die will be marked with a special blue aura. If you kill them, you'll face dire consequences… Wreak Havoc with Future Weapons in Antiquity: Something nearly every gamer that's ever played a shooter based in the past has always wanted is the ability to bring a futuristic weapon back through history and kick some major butt. How differently would Custer's last stand have turned out if the General was equipped with an M-16 assault rifle? You'll be able to answer questions like this in Darkest of Days . While not every battle and situation will allow you to wield weapons from the future, there will be plenty of opportunities for you to unleash futuristic fury on your unsuspecting foes.","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Italian', 'Russian', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/header.jpg?t=1629828351,http://www.darkestofdays.com/,,,True,False,False,0,9574.41,8monkey Labs,Phantom EFX,"Single-player,Partial Controller Support",Action,"Action,FPS,Time Travel,Historical,World War I,First-Person,World War II,Singleplayer,Alternate History","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_787060227ea2ea3452688a59e2998850d62557cf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_884c0ffbd44400230d70f8322f7800046b988117.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_c442a660176f2689d6b32ae7f96718fbe52651d6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_60f5fe8bc6777c7f929e4e364d8e4e1a88cda710.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_799591fcea31a02600309d9bbc0497389c707555.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_2d1d621b0e46eee998a03c869e4530f6fd345035.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_4863789649392bb35b10601798279538edae3867.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_997d709f5768a1d269ae280494f8d70baee03361.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_3bc54fa0185e359b789cb9d8920b55a3ef14077d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_e315859a53c0782c1eaadc32552b442d5bb27143.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_354b91b246a89311eac6cade9629422200b88328.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_fe3976bd193e1ec28cc76ba009c830681331d269.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_7ec30e1ce6f222d81cc95d1ece9665e45317033f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_97f7f7532a0f40f5fb5882609604c18a8175675d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_2a91f9323bd8f594dfe4c4d8303bf74e489ea3c1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_6b4bea7263d6d4cd9f7b7f93c91bb829a10539ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_71665d6d361cf114ead2db59c127d436529c8ce3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_35e1f351f37cce48cbd2d38ce8418e325589db54.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_ea1ef191e11721ebaecfdd89d5b3f07c69f39adc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_6b720a5249e6bc031e59c249628a98d41527db4c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_47f9d712774b3811d532e80371618179000a4c6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_5c60f0e1ecb3edcd240e9f0e2239bc5ea854a733.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_fd249687c6772a59be98575bb712113a37c7d2c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_8ea6c6ef665b2b9969915a3aaaa482f656ad5eee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_f6b3a8d4b72188b0da6bcf37371b0e2294dbfef7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_a28ee85d9dea2fd69fc357a2dc8a33d500d25ce2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_59b577c7e4d1e18430d7752cedd0441f6117c89e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_3f886a235e92b1bb592a621a419ab2e2ea01a562.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/37700/ss_0b517a81aea15b85bd96bb85caeb1031ea738c4b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1629828351",
c0e4753f25ac4fa28f80e16466376142,The Troop,"Dec 21, 2021",35,13,Everyone (E),39.99,0,"On the morning of the 6th June 1944 the Western Allies began the largest seaborne invasion in the history of warfare. D-Day would mark the start of a vicious campaign to wrestle North West Europe from German control. The following months would see the ancient fields, farms and villages serve as a battleground for new, lethal weapons that would become legendary. The Troop follows the campaign of British and Canadian forces as they face the German Heer and SS in Normandy. Take command of infantry, motorised and armoured units in desperate tactical turn-based combat against an AI opponent that is challenging and unpredictable, but fair and fallible. Simple, complete control - The Troop embraces the best traditions of classic tabletop war gaming combined with the interactivity and excitement the digital format affords. You have complete control over your units' actions; tanks will not expose their weak side armour with unexpected pathing, hidden guns will not reveal their positions by firing prematurely, infantry will not flee inexplicably when victory is a few heroic paces away. Your AI opponent has no special knowledge and is subject to all the same rules and restrictions as you. You are free to take your time... but any mistakes are yours and yours alone. Choose your difficulty, play as you want - The Troop does not have one difficulty setting. Instead players can control a variety of feature and information settings to tailor their gameplay experience for the most enjoyable challenge. A game, not a simulation - The Troop is born from a life long passion for WW2 history and turn-based games. Our aim is to give a little glimpse of that history through an enjoyable challenge. The events depicted are set in the broad reality of the historical campaigns, the missions themselves however are fictional and geared towards an enjoyable challenge rather than a strict depiction of history. We hope only to do justice to the spirit of those countless memoirs and after action reports that survive and continue to fascinate us.

Test your business skills by selling your designs in Campaign Mode. Automation’s Campaign Mode starts in 1946, where players test their design skills in a deep simulation of the automotive industry. Build factories and equip them with the facilities and equipment they need, and research cutting-edge technologies to turn your fledgling company into a titan of the industry, by catering to the needs and desires of dynamically-simulated market demographics. Export your cars to BeamNG.drive. Export your creations to BeamNG.drive (sold separately) with Automation’s easy-to-use car exporter to drive, race and crash them yourself! Compare your lap times against Automation's AI and your friends in BeamNG.drive with the co-developed Automation Test Track featured in both games, and share your creations in the BeamNG.drive Mod Repository. Participate in Automation’s passionate and active community. Automation has a large community of 3D modellers creating mod content for the game, with hundreds of free mods available on the Steam Workshop, and more being added every day. Additionally, the Automation community runs a wide variety of exciting, community-designed and led competitions, where cars are evaluated on styling, performance and other traits. Build a car and join the community today, to see how your creations measure up against your new friends!","['English', 'French', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Polish']","['English', 'Polish']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/header.jpg?t=1658647800,http://automationgame.com,http://discourse.automationgame.com,support@camshaftsoftware.com,True,False,False,0,20015.29,Camshaft Software Ltd,Camshaft Software Ltd,"Single-player,Steam Workshop","Indie,Racing,Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Simulation,Management,Building,Sandbox,Strategy,Early Access,Automobile Sim,Realistic,Crafting,Indie,Education,Moddable,Science,Replay Value,Singleplayer,Racing,Economy,Immersive Sim,Choices Matter,Physics","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_19f301581cfe6979128716015df27b7873026127.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_6c50191a53671869859392b00f165a30a79823bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_89cca00fe27fcb40daddd0af9513cfbdf5e2f8bc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_ed502b5ea514a1aa3e57b9aac202a5e12143f52c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_987d4a883652d222232f84851120f5096feb3b6d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_ac7be8af1e6721854e30a3114d96801294d5164a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_c3a373c036c8270d1fdea32a447bc1305449fdcb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_7bb6238f4d618101fa4e0e1b206f3d8a627cc1fc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_d267e9614ca174c0797718a5ad158f51f579af62.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_c935b8ed3e74de4db8fb57e76761f7d7f2ac982a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_2d0f7588f84fe29169bf7044a1a632dfd00deba1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_e9f2b59e134ccfb38b3e2eb39caee3b2f47ebd76.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_e12c4b8dc7165dd02b53aece5a75bb195caa856d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_073a5ae76f361ab16fee072aa927471cf6a13185.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_7d281f16fd9aaeb11e4e48bb894a862ef44fe731.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_eb415a464bb05b333c810c2bce4d6ac5e82b8597.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_4e0f3928fad6183aaa7892a5f4735acef3a554c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_d8a02901553bcca4fb9f6d55c95bdba261807a77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_7a7ce41ccd3a99979163a0d1d5d9379e7d2f7b3d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/293760/ss_d3d5bafeb4ae8a78f22100ffcf9aab7c5805c769.1920x1080.jpg?t=1658647800","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256729572/movie_max.mp4?t=1537320067,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256723648/movie_max.mp4?t=1532559904"

Head to Swindon, UK where everyone’s favorite superhero Amazing Frog? spends all of his chaotic days. Explore Swindon, Do Crimes Amazing Frog? might be Swindon’s very own superhero, but he gets up to some mayhem when the time is right. Flop around town on a variety of vehicles including cars, jet skis, helicopters, biplanes, moon buggies and more. Run over to the fully fitted fart gym for some exercise or dive into the water for a nice swim. The world is yours for the taking! I’m bored. Hello bored, I’m Frog Swindon’s superhero loves a good adventure and there’s loads to get up to if you know the right place to look. When in doubt, definitely do the thing. Amazing Frog? V2 features items such as: balloons, toy guns, baseball bats, crossbows and exploding barrel bombs*. As part of the current process, the Amazing Frog? team is working on bringing loads of features from the legacy version of the game to Amazing Frog V2. That means you’ll be able to also rescue cats, earn Swindon Citizen Points (SCP), earn frog milk coffee tokens, feed the pondemon, enjoy the flys blood world and snow world and much more! *Bombs not recommended for tadpole play The Wilderness Frogsplorer Frogs aren’t the only ones getting up to no good in Swindon. Hop into a boat and you might just come across a deadly shark. We recommend steering clear of them or, even better, steering INTO them. If you’ve got more exotic tastes, the tourism board of Swindon recommends NOT going into the sewers. (We are not part of the tourism board and, therefore, heavily encourage it. You may just find that they open up “out of this world” possibilities.) Hello, is it Frog You’re Looking For? Everyone gets a little lonely sometimes and that’s why Amazing Frog? invited all his friends along to participate in the mayhem. Amazing Frog? V2 offers four player local multiplayer and four player remote play. Get by with a little help from your frogs.

But, I want to be clear that this game is not for everyone. Please look at the description of content below. Features: - Completely original story, where you probably won't know where it's going to go next! - Character-rich story where the game is really about the characters and their journey. - Text heavy game. - No grind imho! Like, literally just walk to where you need to go and you should be the right level. - Tons of jokes made from Wallace Lovecraft himself. - Completely original handdrawn art, all done by Wallace Lovecraft! - Amazing soundtrack with songs made by lovely people! - I would say that it's a casual game and it's pretty forgiving. - 2 choices matter adventure games within the game with multiple endings in both! - Save “pretty much” whenever you want! - Can be played with one hand! - Created by one person, Wallace Lovecraft, except the music! - Action packed with tons of fighting and blood and stuff. - Art, art, art, so much art, like seriously so much art.

Your pieces gain experience points, level ups, and new abilities to unlock and upgrade as you progress through a campaign where every game is unique. ChessLocke uses standard Chess movements on an 8x8 game board, but your pieces will also have a set of new abilities to help you win games. The object of ChessLocke is to land on the enemy Throne and stay there for 1 turn. The Throne is simply the square where the Kings always start. Unlike traditional Chess, if the King is captured, the game continues. Once a game ends, your total experience points (XP) will be accumulated to spend on new abilities and upgrades for those abilities. You will accumulate XP by winning games, capturing enemy pieces, and other various achievements. Each power piece has 3 unique abilities to help win games that may assist in capturing enemy pieces, defending ally pieces, and other utility. For example, the Knight has a Joust ability, which allows a straight-line attack. The Bishop has a Revive ability, which allows the player to bring back a removed piece. The King has Dub Knight, which allows a Pawn to be promoted to Knight for the rest of the game. Players will decide which abilities to purchase to use in game. The single-player Campaign consists of 50 missions where piece placements are different for each game. For example, your Rooks may swap places with your Bishops, you might start with only 5 Pawns, or maybe your Knights start on the 3rd row. There may be Walls placed on certain squares in a game where neither player may land nor pass through, however Knights can jump over Walls as they can jump over ally or enemy pieces. Completing the Campaign unlocks the Dungeon, which is 50 more missions, but instead of each mission having equal pieces and advantages, the Dungeon's opponent will have more pieces and better advantages positional. Each mission will be like a puzzle you must solve.

Mutant viruses have invaded its core and are threatening to destroy it. It’s up to you to take on these waves of viruses and defend the core of cyberspace in a way that prevents any of them from reaching it. But there’s no need to fret – you'll have countless upgrades and a split-personality killer drone to (more or less) help you out! Innovative tower defense experience CyberTD takes the classic tower defense experience and combines it with roguelite elements , creating a captivating mix. With each level-up, you'll unlock new upgrades and gain access to more options for customizing your defense according to your own unique style. Easy to learn, tough to master Though learning the game's simple mechanics is easy, you'll need to come up with an elaborate strategy if you're looking to reach high-score territory. You'll be entertained for plenty of time in your hunt for better upgrades and tactics – and you’ll get some questionable support from a retired killer drone with two feisty personalities. Various game modes You'll always find yourself facing new challenges through these different game modes: Single Player : Viruses charge at you, wave after wave, with mutations that boost their strength and endurance – but you, too, have access to a growing range of effective defense mechanisms designed to stop them. Co-op : Face the waves of enemies as a pair and work together to fight them off for as long as possible. Versus : Face the waves of enemies side-by-side and compete to see who's more successful at fighting them off. Weekly Challenges : A different set of special challenges each week for experienced players – tougher rules come into play here! Community Clash : Fun and exciting games for streamers (Twitch) where your chat takes control of a second player in co-op or versus mode, or determines how the rest of the game unfolds for you through choices! Endless possibilities You have the power to choose what you need to defend against the enemy effectively. Looking to inflict heavy damage or trigger nasty status changes? Eager to level up your weapons or gain powerful abilities? Over 170 different upgrades await you in four different levels of rarity , ready to be unlocked and built to a powerful deck. You can choose one upgrade per enemy wave from a random selection in this pool – so no two games will ever be the same!

He lives with his parents in the sleepy countryside for five years, helping them run their humble family business — while the rest of his friends leave home, and leave him behind. When Mitsuki finally leaves the nest, he’s twenty-three years old, and woefully behind with his studies. If he wants to get accepted into university, he’ll need to re-learn everything he was taught during high school, and then some. Mitsuki moves to Tokyo to attend a rigorous cram school, with the hopes of passing his university entrance exams next spring. He soon finds, however, that his other classmates treat him like a social outcast, being the oldest at his school by far. It proves impossible to make friends, and Mitsuki consigns himself to an isolated, lonely existence... That is, until he meets the single mother, Himuro Kyouko, who just-so-happens to live in the same apartment complex as him. Mitsuki offers to help Kyouko babysit her daughter, Tama. Kyouko, in turn, helps Mitsuki study for his upcoming exams. Over the course of a year, the two bond — first, as friends, and then as something more.

99ca4382191b410b90c4e796e083077e,Touhou Mystia's Izakaya,"Oct 1, 2021",43,608,Everyone (E),5.99,5,"Prelude Today, the young night sparrow youkai Mystia Lorelei is still chasing her dream—— Her dream to become the most popular izakaya owner in Gensokyo. Day after day, she worked hard making a name for herself and attracting customers from all over Gensokyo. Then, on one fateful day, a certain customer paid her a visit. On that day, both her dream and her future were shattered. Having lost everything, she had to restart from scratch. And so, her life indebted to the tyrannical Yakumo family began... “Don’t underestimate a grass root youkai’s aspiration and determination! I will protect thatfull and satisfied smiles of Gensokyo’s people!” The young night sparrow will never give up. Besides, having being helped by Mystia, the powerful residents of Gensokyo will surely return the favor! 1.Core Gameplay A brand new izakaya simulation gameplay! You play as Mystia, the proud owner of a mobile izakaya. During the day, you collect ingredients all over Gensokyo, learn new recipes, collect or buy beverages... all in order to create the perfect dining experience. In other words, there is no battle and no danmaku in this game, only customers with varying demands that you need to fulfill! △You izakaya will be visited by different customers every night. They have different preferences, budget, and favourite dishes. Serve customers and remember their preferences, fill your cooking with music and love, and cook the perfect dish for each customer! Meanwhile, familiar characters from Gensokyomay visit as rare customers.Instead of ordering directly, they only give hints on what they want to eat.If you can satisfy them, they will give you special rewards using their unique “reward spell cards”! If you learn what each reward spell card does and string them into powerful combos, earning a hundred thousand yen a night isn’t a dream! △After satisfying Rumia’s preference, she will happily reward you with three meat ingredients △By satisfying rare customers consecutively, a combo reward is triggered! But what happens if you disappoint them? They will unleash their “punish spell cards” and punish you in the name of Gensokyo! △Serving dishes carelessly earns you a headbutt from sensei. 2.Numerous Characters and Events 2.1 After the first appearance of each rare customer, Mystia will record information about them in her notebook, including their food and drink preferences, frequently appearing areas, and a funny little description. During daytime, she can communicate with them and enhance her bond with them. After reaching a certain bond level, they will provide Mystia with powerful support! Can you become best friends with your favorite characters? △Mystia’s handbook is full of useful information and secrets △As bond level increases, your customers become you friends and can provide you with many supports 2.2 While operating, Mystia will gain many companions, who can help with running the restaurant. They can serve dishes, serve beverages, or cook. With three companions, you can simply sit back and relax while they run the restaurant - though you still need to cater to the rare customers yourself. △Each companion can only perform one job. Set jobs for your companions before you open for business. △Kosuzu is busy cooking, Sakuya is serving beverages, and... Reisen! Stop goofing off! 2.3 By meeting and chatting with your friends, you can learn their stories, build stronger bonds. All your seemingly ordinary friends all have their own stories, and would only share them with you when they consider you a true friend. △Wriggle is already Mystia’s friend, so she speaks casually around her △With business at the shrine improving, Reimu’s brows finally loosened △The memory of Gensokyo, born for the sake of completing the Gensokyo Chronicle, Akyuu has never had a life of her own Each character has their own storyline.If you delve into them, you can learn their stories, whether happy or sad. 3. The bright and colorful world of Gensokyo As the game proceeds, you will gain access to six primary locations: Youkai Trail, Human Village, Hakurei Shrine, Scarlet Devil Mansion, Bamboo Forest of The Lost, and Hakugyokurou. Each of these locations is meticulously illustrated to recreatethe details and settings from the source material. △The starting location, Youkai Trail △The Human Village, crowded and filled with merchants and shops △The quietHakurei Shrine △Home of the jovial devil, Scarlet Devil Mansion △Mysterious, dangerous, yet attractive, the Bamboo Forest of The Lost 4.Charming collectibles Mystia’s basement has plenty of room for all sorts of collectibles, including costumes, event CG albums, soundtrack CDs, and decorations from friends. In the basement, you can put on your favorite costume, view the CGs for events that had occurred, listen to music, or use decorations to improve your business. △Mystia’s closet has many cute costumes △Event CG album, where you can view your favourite events △Music CDs, where you can put your favourite track on loop △Decorations, which grant unique benefits to your business 5.Unforgettable audiovisual enjoyment As a pixel art game, we spent a lot of time on the visual presentation for Touhou Mystia’s Izakaya to create a smooth visual experience for players. Also, every in-game soundtrackwas painstakingly composed, and I believe any one of them can become one of your favorites in your MP3. 5.1 Over 30 desktop-level high resolution pixel CG 5.2 More than 30 finely crafted character artworks 5.3 More than 30 melodious BGM soundtracks There are still more surprises waiting to be found in the game… Become a successful yet personable izakaya owner And

b26d45395101475d880f0face9023633,Defenders of Time,"Nov 4, 2014",51,0,Everyone (E),0.0,0,"Grab your friends because we've done something a little different here at Four Lights. This is a Tower Defense but its not your dad's tower defense... well it kind of is but I'll explain that in a moment. The first thing you need to know is that Defenders of time is fast so rule #1 is don't stop spending. Don't ever stop spending. Don't worry if you made a mistake you can always resell your towers and get all of your money back. Yeah every cent. Yes that's 100% resell. Yes its a Tower Defense. No that doesn't make the DoT easy. Hold on; stop asking me questions let me explain. The Defenders of Time demo gives you unlimited access to try Single Player for free! The best part of our demo is anyone that purchased Defenders of Time can invite you to their games and you can check out multiplayer! The way it works is every person who paid for Defenders of Time can invite up to 3 other players at any time to join their Ranked or Custom matches. Defenders of Time was developed from the ground up as a multi-player game which means: ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As many as 8 players can play 4v4. More importantly only one of you needs to buy the game. everyone else can pitch in for pizza. (WHAT?!) Players all have the same abilities except the commander who focuses on balancing defense and offense. Players win and lose as a team. There is no MVP so don't be selfish. Jimbob42 needs that tower on the right so HELP HIM. The game is fast. Use the 'R' key. Shortcuts are your friends... also they will make you popular... and get you dates. I'm a huge fan of weird food at odd times. There is a lot to do. See fast above and dynamic below. DoT is dynamic. You will be destroyed, annihilated, obliterated and humiliated if you hold onto those green towers as air zips overhead so don't. We already talked about 100% sell. Kittens make up half of the internet, Doge makes up the other half, and rule 34 makes up the other other half. We've got built in mic support and we've got selective mute. Where do you adjust this you ask? In game. You don't have time to dig through menus. well I don't at any rate. Don't forget to draw! Hold shift and move your mouse. Five years from now... Remember you saw it here first. We made sharing money easy. Don't panic. Someone might know what to do. Co-op only is a thing. Just make a team in custom games and don't populate the other side. We've got six insanely repayable multi-player maps right now. That's five more than football has and five more than most mobas have. More are coming soon because the art team wants to explore all of space and time... Don't feel bad about bugging Corey (AKA Dession on Steam). He's our lead tester and he loves talking to you guys. So do I for that matter. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- So, back to the part about this not being your dad's tower defense. That's somewhat true. The less true part of that statement is that we looked long and hard at the old tower defenses like Wintermaul Wars and Ark TD and said we want to make something like that but better balanced , with more maps, and with art that really fits. If you want to invite someone who doesn't own the game just have them download the demo which will be on steam shortly or directly from our site and have them sign up for an account and in the upper right hand corner of the game just add them as a friend and click invite next to their name and poof they have full access to the game without buying it so long as you're playing with them.

Soul Survivors places a heavy focus on skill-based gameplay that is carefully blended with roguelite elements and mechanics unique to the genre. In the complete version of the game, you can unlock and play as one of 6 unique risen heroes. At launch in Early Access, 2 characters will be available. Each hero has their own specialized game-defining mechanics, as well as completely unique abilities and meta progression. The Bogatyr - A renown knight who fell in battle. This hero, stalwart and hardy, focuses on heavy defenses and uses the power of the gods to imbue earth into his short range attacks. The Pyromancer - A nomad who was imprisoned until his demise. This hero uses the ancient elemental art of Pyromancy. His wide chaotic attacks sweep the lands and incinerate his enemies. The Necromancer - A duke who succumbed to the dark arts. This hero reanimates the husks of the dead to do his bidding. He channels an array of spirit attacks and thrashes his enemies at close range with his flail. The Ranger - A warden who lost her life defending the wildwood. This hero uses her innate agility to weave in and out of battle. In the shadows she sets deadly traps and as her enemies close in she unleashes a torrent of arrows. The Fighter - A martial artist whose debts caught up to him. This hero utilizes his fast reflexes to pummel his enemies with quick strikes. Weaving in and out of combat he can unleash disabling combos. The Blood Maiden - An armor-clad maiden who was sacrificed by a religious sect. This hero uses her sanguine glaive to release a flurry of sweeping strikes. Trailing the blade is an endless downpour of corrupted blood. Each run allows you to study your enemies and hone your skills. Once you have mastered the basics, Soul Survivors introduces many unique enemy archetypes, exciting boss designs, fresh mechanics and a specialized hero system. Unlock and explore 2 different lands, with a total of 4 planned when the game is complete. Each land has its own unique bosses, enemy archetypes and environmental hazards. Linden Forest - A once green pasture now lies in ruins. The guardians of this forest haunt it from the very graves they built. Usvit Castle - The shining light from the days of old. A demonic presence often heard but never seen, ushers waves of fear throughout the castle walls. Usvit Depths - The old servants' quarters. Now a slime ridden passage where not even the bravest adventurers set foot. Ashendusk Mountains - Rivers of lava run through these scorched lands. Denizens of fire invoke fear and incinerate ill-prepared adventurers. ---------------------------------------------------------------- CURRENT RELEASE Early Access - v0.4 Completion of the Necromancer Class Completion of the Bogatyr Class - Rebalanced with new Skills and Abilities Enter the Usvit Depths - New Unlockable Area Available Skill rework and upgrades for existing classes 6 Unique Bosses and Mini Bosses Talents Altar Sacrifices Power-ups Achievements Secrets! ---------------------------------------------------------------- COMING VERY SOON Ranger Update - v0.5 New Character Class: The Ranger Item Drop meta Progression Merchant/Shop System Adjustments based on EA feedback! ---------------------------------------------------------------- PREVIOUS RELEASES Necromancer/Catacombs Update - v0.3 Introduction of the Necromancer Class - New Hero *COMPLETE* Enter the Usvit Depths - New Area - *COMPLETE* Skill rework and upgrades for existing classes Tons of new enemies Tons of new features Early Demo Release - v0.2 Introduction of the Bogatyr Hero - A long since deceased warrior of the old, risen again to assist in the cleansing of Linden Forest.

One of the most critically acclaimed and commercially successful arcade games of the 1980s is back in its Classic pixel perfect 2D form, and a re-imagined Reboot version with state of the art 3D game-play and graphics that remain faithful to the original concept. Both versions are exciting twitch games requiring keen puzzle solving skills and logic. First introduced in 1982 by Gottlieb, Q*bert was critically-acclaimed and went on to become the third most successful arcade game of all time (behind Pac-Man and Donkey Kong). It inspired home versions, a variety of Q*bert merchandise, numerous copycat games and even an animated TV series. Q*bert Classic stays true to the original in all its jagged 2D pixel art glory, now optimized for the modern PC with mouse and Steam gamepad controls. As the title character, players jump around an isometric cube pyramid and convert each block’s color while avoiding familiar adversaries Coily, Ugg, Slick, Sam, Wrong Way and Red Ball. Levels become progressively harder with more enemies blocking your path and the tiles requiring multiple jumps to change to the required color. Q*bert Rebooted takes the arcade classic and catapults it into the 21st century 3D game play that takes full advantage of today’s technologies yet remains faithful to the original Q*bert. Featuring hexagonal blocks instead of squares, Q*bert Rebooted introduces new enemies, playable characters, power-ups, traps, gem collecting and characters, and new ways to play. Q*bert Rebooted highlights: Level Select – replay all previously unlocked levels and track progress against friends. 7 New Playable Characters – introducing Q*zard, Q*bertha, Q*bot, Q*zilla, Q*tee, Q*knight and Q*nicorn, all based on the original Q*bert form. 3 New Enemies – the classic cast of adversaries are joined by new enemies Homer, Uppercut and Treasure Chest 9 Achievements – these include Classic Master, Newbert, Qbertorama, Snake Surprise, Green Machine, Ugg!, Down for the Count, Disc Rider and Coin-Op Collector.",['English'],['English'],“Pretty @!#?@!ing Good” Gamezebo “Rebooted mode is definitely fun - the difficulty curve is perfect” IGN “Q*Bert Rebooted For Today's Short Attention Span Gamers” Kotaku,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/header.jpg?t=1536937602,http://www.qbert.com,,support@sidelinamusements.com,True,True,True,9,16638.47,"Sideline Amusements,Gonzo Games","Sideline Amusements,Gonzo Games","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Stats,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Casual,Indie","Action,Casual,Arcade,Indie,Retro,Classic","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_0c703e5006ec8b8c4396dc086a12c2d91bd7da70.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_d5f790e7f3eb52b90b3834a0122384694338e469.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_91b4f8b89184fb03ae59b105577a792f28e8d3d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_aeb06b3d5486e0986b2ccb7dccb6039ec81fbf55.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_2100162a216281d3bc857b20b6ed2712db77e13f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_b20e0b44dba2b89e0c9585605b6bede98f6dfd89.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_b921469b05ab1df1c2bade572bca2280bce40ddd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_8c0bee280d4fd506f55014db041197083f5fa205.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_cfc28bfcd3d0a425cbe96a081d498839a3dade24.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/285960/ss_1bbf30a031dc37f3766f5f9d2b4942686aaad96a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1536937602",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2033265/movie_max.mp4?t=1447362585

Every time you fire, you'll have to answer one of over 4,000 trivia questions with answers based on numbers, percentages, geography, dates, and more - the further you are from the actual answer, the more of its own ammunition the revolver will discharge. If you run out, it's back to Randco HQ to reload!

097e7ac6b95940d5aeefc84825225f23,Experimental,"Feb 15, 2021",48,0,Everyone (E),7.99,0,"About: Experimental is an old-school 3D platformer where you have to complete levels in order to unlock new levels. Some levels have different unlock requirements like time, score collected or attempts needed. If you fail to unlock a level you can always try again, but you cannot save the game inside a level. Your best attempts are saved so you can always try to improve your results. Use various items scattered throughout the levels. Keys are needed to unlock some doors. Score items are sometimes required to unlock new levels. Weapons are sometimes necessary to survive the onslaught of enemies some of which can respawn just like you. Armor can give you an advantage by making you take less damage or sometimes even nullifying the damage done by weak enemies. Explosives can be used to take quick care of large amount of enemies, but be careful as explosions affect everything around. Some objects can be moved or destroyed when they block your path forward. However, be careful when moving heavy objects as they may end up on top of you. Not all robots you encounter are enemies. Some robots can help you by throwing items to you that you wouldn’t be able to reach otherwise. You may even try to give these robots some spare weapons and armor and see what happens. About workshop: If you know how to use Blender, 3ds Max or some other 3d modeling software, you can try to make your own custom levels and if you want to, you can share them with other players through workshop. Custom folder contains 2 example levels made in Blender and 3ds Max that show, how levels for Experimental are made.","['English', 'German', 'Czech', 'Italian', 'Polish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/header.jpg?t=1613376226,,,kurikm2@azet.sk,True,False,False,15,32342.35,Cold-Dark Software™,Cold-Dark Software™,"Single-player,Steam Achievements","Action,Indie",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/ss_0ddd226edbaa3deb05c2484ab2dd64d8e8a83c91.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613376226,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/ss_af80164cea9fcecebe36af5f3c430dad0520d76c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613376226,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/ss_b8d33e2627fe0d5c642ccebbb51e306d0989901e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613376226,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/ss_3239b001eb9a7c3801854fbd8ff145531f78bdd3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613376226,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/ss_b866592d44f2e7f4faab05ad1d44892fa9195d88.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613376226,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/ss_6ddf7b7a0e5876011702e0e3be992b01cb3eace7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613376226,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/ss_c32b2271eccc75e7cd8d450a70345c5cb732d5a5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613376226,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/ss_9c77f364eb1b4c5107596203d6fbb453a7d11ead.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613376226,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1498440/ss_ff89738199d75f92aabe1595e0fd343e3213af03.1920x1080.jpg?t=1613376226",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256813734/movie_max.mp4?t=1612167893

Ever since we were born, we've had the net; the world being connected was simply a matter of fact. I've never once questioned why keyboards are arranged in QWERTY. Neither have I wondered how to use a mouse. Social media feels far more comfortable than a telephone does. The world is always connected. The world is always open. In the sea of the net, colored by a prism, they looked up at the sky and declared: ― We are hackers ― Hacking Hacking: what other word could be so divisive between society's impressions and the actuality? The word brings to mind someone furiously typing against a black and white screen, trying to infiltrate the Pentagon. On the other hand, you have the news reporting information leaks and cyber attacks on a near-constant basis. So what exactly are hackers, as well as crackers? As opposed to days long past, where one would attach a virus to an email, how would today's 'hacking' compare? A hacker in the game says: 'The way we see it, this world is so full of holes, it's downright scary.' Nowadays, you could connect to the net with just about any PC out there, and with just a measly 10 dollars, you can get your hands on some hacking tools and manuals. The game begins with a hacking contest, 'CTF', and shows a slice of their own worlds. Story There once was a legendary hacker named 'Warlock'. Hiro, who lives his life in a net cafe, is inspired to look into that hacker. However, as he continues his investigation, a fatal fire accident breaks out at an editorial company -- his source of information. As he probes further, he finds logs that show that the company's systems were hacked into. He decides to team up with Misa, another hacker with the same skills as Warlock, as they delve deeper into the incident.

Her guts! Snacking on her favorite foods might give her more♪ 2) Tobaris - The number of chances Tobari has left. Falling in a pit or losing all your health will use one up. If you run out, it's Game Over for you! 3) Coins - Your money. Used to buy goods at the shop. There's loads of it to be found! Makes the world go 'round! 4) Magic - The spells Tobari has on her. She can hold two at a time. Be smart about switching between the slots! The pause menu also has a brief description of your current spell. Default Keys (Going to Key Config is recommended before you start playing.) Arrow Keys/Direction Pad - Moves Tobari around or makes her duck. Up and Down let her climb ladders. She'll dash around everywhere - no need to hold any buttons♪ Z/PADButton0 - Uses your current spell! (Serves as the confirmation key on menus.) When you don't have any magic, you can give things a whack with your Keystaff. If the enemy you whack possesses some magic, you'll get their Magic Medal! X/PADButton1 - Makes Tobari jump. (Serves as the cancel key on menus.) You can jump a little higher by holding it longer. Give it a tap, and it'll just be a little hop. C/PADButton3 - Hold this while moving, and Tobari will walk instead of run. Handy for precise movements. It could have its uses! V/PADbutton4 - Poofs away your current magic, leaving it behind in medal form. Go ahead and discard any magic you don't need. It'll disappear soon enough, so it won't get in your way! B/PADButton5 - Switches between your two spells. Make smart use of the two slots! Be careful, as you can't switch spells in the middle of using one! SPACE/PADButton6 - Opens the menu.

You start with a team of 6 random characters, and try to make your way through a single labyrinth. Each character has a Class and Race that influence them at the start, and you can find things along the way to stay strong as you try and reach the exit. There are 105 classes and 28 races, but only 4 races per class for a total of 420 characters (each race used 15 times). Some classes fill a similar niche, such as the Cleric, Healer, and High Priest all being Devotion-focused healing classes. They differ in their unique skills, such as the Cleric's passive that increases their Devotion stat as a battle goes on, the Healer's 'Simple Labor' skill that lets them weakly heal someone without using up their turn, or the High Priest's 'Desperation' skill that fully heals an ally while stunning themself. Races range from the typical like Dwarves (+30% Hp, Armor; -30% Speed, Evasions) to the less common like the flashy Kitsune (+30% STR/AGI/LOG/DEV/SPD; three times as likely to be targeted by enemy attacks) to the unusual like Slimes (Regens 10% Hp &amp; Mp each turn, +100% Speed, can acts twice each turn; cannot use any Equipment). There are Toilets to scavenge equipment from, Computers to print out more Skill Licenses from, and Vending Machines to buy consumables from. There are also monsters, and a single door. Do your best to make it to the exit! There is no persistent progress or saving; each run is its own thing. Once you beat the boss or all party members die, that's the end. This is not a story-rich game or one where much information is given at all. This is not a roguelike where you can get a 'God-run' and everything goes great. This is a game where you and your group is lost in a dungeon, and there is no one and nothing to save you but yourself. While each dungeon is just one floor, it's expansive enough to make getting lost easy.

e68304c08b6547429fff98d0008565df,Heat Signature,"Sep 21, 2017",55,64,Everyone (E),14.99,1,"Break into spaceships! Fly your pod up to any spaceship in the galaxy and dock with its airlock to sneak inside. From there, you've got to sneak up on the crew, outshoot them in slowmo gunfights, or outthink them with clever gadgets. Take missions to steal loot, assassinate VIPs, or rescue friends. Take your time! Get out of impossible situations by pausing at any time and taking as long as you need to figure out a clever plan. You have a wide range of gadgets with clever uses, and you can switch, aim and fire them with no time pressure at all, letting you pull off ridiculously cool tricks without needing twitch skills. Liberate the galaxy! All your missions get you closer to liberating new space stations from the empires that control them, and this unlocks new gadgets to buy in your shops, and special challenge characters to play. Lots more features! I'm not making GIFs for all these! I'm not made of GIFs! I'm not some kind of GIF-golem! Emergent gameplay! Use gadgets like teleporters, stealth shields and subverters to invent your own solutions to tricky situations. Galactic zoom! Zoom smoothly from a view of the whole galaxy down to your character sneaking up on guards inside the spaceship you're boarding. Choose your difficulty! You choose each mission, ranging from trivially easy to nightmarishly hard. There's also a practice mode where you can try items and tactics with no consequences and instant-restart. Randomly generated missions! Each one picks a random combination of guard kit, ship layout, and complications like space battles. Each life is a new character! Choose between randomly generated characters with different starting kit, and when you die, play as someone new in the same galaxy. Personal missions! Every character has one grand heist to work towards: rescue their brother, steal their gun back, get revenge on their partner's killer. Modular destruction! Blow up any part of a ship with breach grenades or fuel barrels. Rip a ship in half. Get sucked into space by the vacuum. Rescue your friends' characters! If someone on your friends list gets their character captured, and they aren't able to rescue them, maybe you can! You'll sometimes get a character whose personal goal is to rescue a friend's character. If you manage it, you unlock your friend's character to play as! They don't get it back. They had their chance. It's yours now. Find your friends' items! When you retire an accomplished character, you can choose one item to pass on. You get to name it, and both your Steam friends and your own future characters have a chance to find these as loot. Equally, you'll come across items your friends have named. What Heat Signature is not: We don't want you to buy Heat Signature if it's not for you. We'd always rather have a happy non-customer than an unhappy customer. So here's what it isn't: - It's not story-driven: there's a backstory to this place and a few conversations with characters, but there's not a story that develops as you play. It's much more about the stories you generate by playing, about how you got out of impossible situation X or pulled off crazy stunt Y. There aren't other careers: You can't mine asteroids. You can't build ships. You can't recruit a crew. You're an infiltrator, you break into spaceships for a living, it's all about that. There are no planets: The whole game takes place in this nebula full of space stations. You can dock at any friendly station and board any hostile ship, but it's not a space exploration game.

About this Video This video was recorded on a videotape from an unknown sender that was sent to the bereaved family in December of the year following the incident.

Through a videotape sent to the bereaved family of the mysterious death, the player can relive the unexplained case and experience the eerie and unexplainable horror.

Anchor Club, relying on Steam's network and creative workshops, aims to provide a platform for anchor enthusiasts to create and share their own works, as well as to participate in the creation process of others' works. Because of our hobby, we created the app 'Anchor Club', and because of our hobby, we want to let more people know about Anchor, create and share here, so Anchor Club is free forever. In Anchor Club, authors can create rooms and create online. We expect that one day there will be a moment when 250 people will come together to witness the birth of an Anchor piece. Because this application is permanently free, if you want to support our studio, you can buy the DLC, so that we can have more motivation to improve this platform, thanks. Any questions or suggestions: StarSeekerGameStudio@gmail.com Anchor Club is not trying to outlaw the forum, but more of a creative way to supplement it, where authors can create, then export the text and share it elsewhere. Anchor Club compared to the forum. Made for Anchor, a more comfortable visual experience Support for creative workshops Authors can upload their edited property cards, character cards, and scripts to Steam Creative Workshop Real-time creation Viewers can exchange jokes in the built-in chat system. Audience participation Authors can initiate audience randomization (where the audience randomly selects options locally and passes them to the author, with the highest number of options being the final result) and audience voting (where the audience selects the results from existing options and passes them to the author, with the highest number of options being the final result) Built-in notes feature Public notes (visible to everyone in the room) and private notes (visible only to the author), as well as each character having their own notes.

eebb0bfebf9942cbb6123418f31658d5,MY FOX - Desktop Wild Pet,"Jun 22, 2021",44,2,Everyone (E),3.99,0,"'MY FOX' is a continuation of the 'WILD PET' project in which we take care of a small animal who gets to know the world with us. All of this is displayed as the desktop wallpaper so you can an eye on your fox. We are probably the only one presenting a similar project. The fox reacts to your commands, asks what to do when it sees something interesting. You can call him, stroke him and throw balls. The fox grows over time. You will start with a little fox that will grow and get bigger over time. We had a lot of inquiries about the possibility of taking care of another animal. The fox seemed perfect so we planned this sequel by building a new bigger world with new stories to discover. 'MY FOX' also allows you to transfer to the magical world. Main features: The game is displayed as wallpaper. Everything happens in the background while you are working on something else. Interactive little fox that will grow up. Take care of a little fox that will grow with age to discover new possibilities of the wild and magical world. It is up to you how the fox will grow up. More terrain and new opportunities. The new map will allow for longer exploration and new opportunities will allow the fox to move to the new magical world. Beautiful graphics with many settings. Relaxing graphics that are built to not burn your PC. A dedicated graphics card is recommended. Day and night system. The game changes the time of day your fox will react to and the darker night colours will not strain your eyes. Smaller features: The game will automatically start with your computer. The game will pause when you start another game to give you full computer power. The game supports multiple screens. Additionally, you can change the camera settings in the menu. Additional optimization that only generates objects that are visible. 'MY FOX' is created by our new extended team. New opportunities and new ideas should add variety to this beautiful game.

f74fdb5d007c4b30accf7f797c1db179,Trail Hogs,"Apr 8, 2023",53,0,For Adult (A),5.0,0,"Overview The Trail Hogs is a bicycle jousting game. Right now it is a 2D platform game similar to Super Mario except that you joust your opponent, whom is also on a bicycle, by running into him very similar to bumper cars. These bikes are also equipped with springs behind the rear axle to allow them to jump similar to a pogo stick, hence the high jump. In the game you ride a bike and battle opponents who have taken over various areas. The game consists of a main hub world called Hog Haven - a bicycle city. From there the player looks for secret passages and warp while upgrading their bike in order to fight the ringleader of the Skidmarks bicycle gang, The Pork. The player cannot die in the game. There are no lives and in many places the player can fall down a pit and arrive in the sewers of Hog Haven. From there they can backtrack or look for other areas. The game can be hard without being able to retry areas multiple times but it is not impossible like Kazio Mario hacks. The enemies attempt to push the player off the ledges. A variety of attacks are used to do this including projectile weapons. Another aspect of the game is that the player can be trapped in cages where the player can't move at all! This is soft blocking but it is a literal feature of the game. The game allows resetting without actually resetting the game which places the player in a rescue house. Background Story The story takes place after the creation of the Trail Hog bike and the city of Hog Haven. During its foundation all bicycle gangs were united into the Trail Hogs but shortly after they split into the Trail Hogs and the Skidmarks, a rowdy group of cyclists. Currently, the Skidmarks have taken over the city by misting it with a foul smelling mist that only a prankster could come up with. Their ringleader, The Pork, has orchestrated this and is said to be the best bicycle Ninja the city has ever seen. Frankus seeing the plight of the Hogs moves out to reclaim his bicycle kingdom! Game Structure This game consists of a city broken up into many areas. There is a map screen which can only be accessed by tagging goals to finish an area or by entering an exit pipe. You move through areas looking for tokens and the leader of the Skidmarks, The Pork, in order to fight him. In this game you do not die. You are simply pushed around by your rivals and off platforms if you are high up. All their efforts can make you waste more time in an area. However, in some instances if you fall off a cliff you can end up in another area! You collect tokens and other treasures throughout the game by finding them and winning races. To earn from a race you must beat the best time. Tokens are used to buy items that you might need, mostly for modding your bike. Status Display The 'FL' shaped item is a token. You collect these to open up levels and to buy mods for your bike. If you lose a mod for your bike you can get a replacement free of charge. Also the number of tokens you have does not go down when you buy anything. Some areas on the map will also require a certain number of token to enter. Your speed is measured by the power meter on the right. When it turns green you are at full speed. The fastest a bike can go is 20 miles per hour. You also see bomb and rocket symbols on the left of the screen. These keep track of bombs and rockets that you pick up in the game. Keep track of these because in some areas they are critical to passing to the next area. In some levels you will race against a clock. Your time counts backwards from 1000 seconds. You'll want to get to the goal tape at the end of the level as fast as you can. This will set your best time. Come back again and try to beat it! This game may be unique in that you can intentionally get soft blocked. Here is an example where your character can fall into a trap set up by the Skidmarks. If you get stuck here you must be rescued and to do that you must call a rescue. This is done by pressing the (R) on the keyboard or (L) on the gamepad. The rescue house is in the city and that's where you'll be taken. Another important aspect to remember is that in this game you cannot die. Enemies do not hurt you but they can push you off of ledges and ropes which can result in you falling into a sewer or into another area. In some cases you will be pushed off of a ledge but can climb back up without having the exit the area!",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/header.jpg?t=1681012299,https://www.codeloader.dev,https://www.codeloader.dev,,True,False,True,0,23825.59,"Codeloader,Francois","Codeloader,Francois",Single-player,"Action,Adventure,Indie",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_18500280a807396b99e9c7d2213f098871cb8b17.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_fa4195c66753bb177dec67897487b1a07310b982.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_9c965b600e990a837d51d0f2480c3d3298eca715.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_bc2383ad114501701180d1072edf17c1c40862b8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_38662330d5add78c52afa3c7c60ac243f971367a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_414a90697e4b457e6f892cb6fd9a6f9ca1f57c86.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_5835e0abca4a1b5bb7dce6e377c4d1b5e50dcb01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_cc4aded830990ca2e7e408720989a9f330e1c9bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_4aac4d87f8f7421942451082b84839a9685eb4aa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_e4dda57e86cc1ca73d448e79a805b9c37d434bdb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_cd5cb2a90b85dd4b749629916557ba2fd776957e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_2284a2cbb95a0b59307022aa4f8a261b0f418df7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2359020/ss_16a28d7bcfa90bd6d7e1fee7e2a39d4a6c554014.1920x1080.jpg?t=1681012299",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256935688/movie_max.mp4?t=1679791290

b09a5ab142bf4618bb9a9b48ac951ba7,Star Explorers,"May 8, 2018",45,0,Everyone (E),4.99,0,"Notice Star Explorers is a game made by a single person over the course of many years - janky behavior may be experienced. You may reach out to the developer on the Steam forum or Discord server with any questions, bug reports or insults. Version 5.0 Earth has been destroyed, and humanity must find a way to survive. Star Explorers grants players a tremendous amount of freedom and agency in how to approach the game without holding your hand, but with freedom comes responsibility and consequences. Take risks and reap the rewards in your efforts to find a new home for the human race in this open world space exploration game. Reviews: '...See, the galaxy Schmidt has created here isn't cruel. 'Cruel' implies that it cares. And this galaxy is terribly, terribly uncaring...' - MagFlare – Steam User '...This game, at its core, is about exploration, and it scratches my space exploration itch in a way that no game has since I played Starflight as a kid...' - battlescar2014 – Steam User Planets Planets are formed randomly, but their conditions are based on somewhat scientific factors. The size and temperature of the star they orbit, their distance from that star, the type of surface, atmosphere, and liquids present (or not) determine how a planet will look once landed on. Players will be able to land, depart and return to planets, exploring their surfaces as well as underground cave systems repeatedly, while keeping the same features intact on each visit. Exploration Fuel, ammunition and oxygen will all have to be carefully managed if the player wants to survive the long search for an earth-like planet. While many planets will be too hot or cold, or without an atmosphere, there are also worlds of liquid methane, ammonia, sulphuric acid and more, that have developed their own unique evolutionary cycles. Each kind of alien plant, tree or animal is pieced together randomly, making for a unique experience for each player. The Star Explorers universe is not a friendly one though, it can be cruel and indifferent to the struggles of its inhabitants. If you're not careful, you might land on a planet that's just too hot, or too cold, or enveloped in a cloud of corrosive acid, and not live to tell about it. Upgrading your space suit will open these otherwise impossible worlds to further exploration. Inventory, Upgrading and Crafting Exploration will allow the player to discover many things, including tools and resources that will help in further exploration. Among these are raw materials, weapons, armor upgrades and blueprints that allow you to craft helpful items. Armor upgrades will increase your space suit's resistance to heat, cold and other environmental hazards. Some weapons allow you to access areas that may be closed off to less experienced adventurers. Caves and Ancient Ruins Star Explorers may be the first interstellar dungeon crawler. Traversing the dark, hidden places and caves is necessary to find the resources required to complete the game. Discover the crumbling remains of an ancient culture and learn the secrets of its mysterious people. In Star Explorers, exploration and investigation are rewarded with special items and locations that many players may never find. If you are someone who likes to look around every corner, then this is the game for you. Generative Design Almost everything in Star Explorers is produced generatively. From the locations of stars and nebulae, to the surfaces of planets and their features, every location is different, and every play-through offers unique challenges. Even the music heard in game is generated in real time, and is based purely on the parameters of the player's environment. Each planet, cave and other location has a unique sound-track. The Future of Star Explorers Star Explorers is still in development. You can see update announcements here on the store page, and in the community hub. Version 5.0 is well underway, and will be released some time in the Fall. It includes a number of new features in including an improved star chart, alien city, more dialogue options, mothership interior, tornadoes, meteors, sand planets and much more in terms of small improvements and updates. A full feature list will be compiled when it is ready for full release.",['English'],['English'],“No Man's Sky 1999.” El Oschuro,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/header.jpg?t=1640882597,,http://schmidtworkshops.com/,michael@schmidtworkshops.com,True,False,False,23,25145.64,Schmidt Workshops,Schmidt Workshops,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG,Simulation","Exploration,Space,Sandbox,FPS,Immersive Sim,Dungeon Crawler,Survival,Crafting,Space Sim,Action RPG,RPG,First-Person,Open World,Procedural Generation,Action,Simulation,Sci-fi,Atmospheric,Adventure,Aliens","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_0cfd8454dfdcf68aeaba807b51e9ed11a2c5db25.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_30b3ac88d84a4d145177623bb360af9a4d08efc9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_564bb3ff9bb767821b01f495f707f3043589f14c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_3b98d978e474122ac5960c4f679f60f027866c99.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_766e33ca256a69622948ffead98de8673f79b4fe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_378885f9e659e5f609878fb384d40ebe4467fa54.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_a3130bbf5c60e55b321175b5619a7a01d2c84299.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_7c138382fb2d9236feba9cc2a20f9b096176093f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_f1985aabe9f8ca41b1688a6be77f625a886e45d1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_536874b240c47d3d363e9910ec08b623eb9e371b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_980592ac6a5fda3dd5804ed5644f78c22da424dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_0f884cfc5d854125c9d6c99569bbc34c4776e876.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_982dd28ab97a802aaff2e4b38c680e1e11137674.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_8b090ecb7ee005561b5d856d72d4a376db1f41bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_58455720603cec5c9064cd0c8d55b820873e1f81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/502720/ss_b33c8f7bb23e2eace96c1ad96b2f2bb79b329e72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1640882597",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256846888/movie_max.mp4?t=1640882587

Not because you are being killed by things you could not possibly know - you perfectly know what's what but you still can't pull off the moves. In some platformers you spend 10 minutes on a level that can be passed in under 15 seconds. You might look at SLIDE's footage and think that it's an easy game. But you would be wrong. SLIDE is a hardcore 2d platformer where you run, jump and (often) die. No enemies, no blowing stuff up. What makes this game stand out - for better or worse - is a system of contextual jumps which allows to perform dozens of jumps simply by combining direction keys with the 'jump'. You can even jump down.

If you spend a little time getting to know this shooter-brawler hybrid, you'll want to dig deeper to check out each character's moves, test her unique combat abilities against other adversaries, and grab a pal to pummel over and over again.” Gamespot",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/header.jpg?t=1447359515,http://www.rockinandroid.com/games/gameinfo.php?id=suguri-collection,http://rockinandroid.com/,support@rockinandroid.com,True,False,False,18,30846.37,Orange_Juice,"Rockin Android,Rockin' Android","Single-player,Multi-player,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Action,Indie","Anime,Action,Indie,Bullet Hell,Fighting,Shoot 'Em Up,Female Protagonist,Local Multiplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_a7621fbf5caae6e0d4d6eb76e962f6602935a5ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_1b75f26f87eb826f6b4745ba8a38ddccf61631c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_56bf1bce2ae1a1c9d52ab516ea600db30ce10a10.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_f0795f0458a0a9d8be4bb755423e74b55635f54f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_543d1d890f1dd16d87c6b95eb3e8b0034f4ad0f1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_a263c3b5bbd0b032228a889712a3b29878be9111.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_83dfb88d6b1b52fd611b7a275dd11806c894fae6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_452110952ec203a6c8a603f8a3590d1786f69db4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_44dae9c7e74683da06a135c14b324aa8b03f267f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_4b11a0d6ed1840607a997a2e2929f3d886808d2d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_e2793b8ff632160bfa310b762c35b4c7c8e45f63.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_d1540e12221df091f106aacc74425e2dbf8affcc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_e4ac2f41b0e5a4dc5034654e8926e3649888b83a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_0be4c2b2c16784b6c51c79103b65562033d13314.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_53763256fb27729c1f75859508ae66eb6c9f5ff8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_cc2f618d6ed59d9331ef145353c45cf327cdd01d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_80ef2b32e2a473024333c37bf3ea2c2895bd7d88.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_3ec071531640cdc704e423ed43a1972a3aa579c0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_1128d5b2e121b41a1cad92c4c89f32e0117c4d85.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/265170/ss_5d90b92016b7b22b53bd65977c543f8514a670e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1447359515",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2030383/movie_max.mp4?t=1447359735

You wake up in the desert, hungover, unable to remember what happened to you (obliviously). You find the an old Scottish owl, the guardian of the Holy Grail, just lying there next to your smelly bulk! He's got a foul mouth on him and tells you that you need to drink to stay alive and get special powers. Great lesson for the wee kids, I know... You use your new-found powers to retrace your steps, drunk-box the skeleton army (which you awoke, of course), solve puzzles (often by peeing on them) and get back to your beautiful bride-to-be, all the while trying to piece together what happened last night. It's a story of a medieval bachelor party gone very wrong... You'll need to escape the desert and find your way out of the Great Pyramid, make friends with different people and creatures to help you along the way, walk through a sexy-parrot-infested jungle, hire a skeleton pirate to get you across the sea (guess how that turns out), visit the underwater world of the sirens (of course), save a bunch of kids from fanatical priests, and so on.

Discover how much stardust you have inherited from T-Rex. Complete a series of quests. Find the hidden treasure. Interact with dinosaurs. Escape from Earth before the meteor seals your fate. Single player and 1-4 player versions to play with friends and family. Episode 1: MissionKT follows the four-member CREW of the Cosmic Egg (time, space, and size-change travel ship) as they visit the dinosaur extinction era to find out how much STARDUST (atoms) they inherited from the Last T-Rex. They are in the Cosmic Egg when the killer asteroid hits the earth and they return to Earth to learn why the land dinosaurs died and why some species survived. Players learn about the size and number of atoms in their body, and how their atoms have been recycled and inherited from plants and animals that lived before them. They also learn how objects are made of different combinations of atoms that result in different object properties. Exploring the world of dinosaurs and completing quests is fun, while learning about one of the most amazing science stories ever discovered: We are made of Stardust, formed in the explosive death of stars, that were once in the body of Albert Einstein and the last T-Rex. It is the story of the atoms that make up our bodies and everything around us. They were created in cataclysmic events during the evolution of the universe and have been shared by the animals and plants that live with us and those that lived before us.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/header.jpg?t=1599584329,https://thestardustmystery.com/,https://thestardustmystery.com/support/,,True,True,False,0,12198.92,TheBeamerLLC,TheBeamerLLC,"Single-player,Multi-player,Co-op,Online Co-op",Adventure,,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_eaa9139a9c5135d5946f438204efb2fb13cf5694.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_dacc671e8ac561460dab0db8db808f1cd2b8898a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_832853410d7c0feccc6b079125abdb8fc81ee30e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_15af813211c0a0a64a51a8bd0d20e80eb2ebc1d3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_ca6d7fd8355be5235c4af446a4b7bca004ebd5bb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_25556a53ee33179f03155e716429247c71c67623.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_cb4eb8a39acc21b67749c2af8463c16ab2fbc6df.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_f0cb15005cd8b530e1d749f0241bfc3b963f1819.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_17043ddaa57fbfb23d4037487deec20f8b196347.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_eebb830a464a95007552118764d0933ecba2fc7f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_c995471e445f01d27c7c86b6b63a9ef31eece227.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1267680/ss_0990df37c9b66746030210cd44a8a2e9dbe088e1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1599584329",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256800093/movie_max.mp4?t=1599508640

The goal of the game is to leave two pieces on the board (one of each color) by following the rule: 'Blue eats blue, red eats red.' A puzzler that is deceptively simple but hard to master. Moving pegs. Removing pegs. These two simple mechanics allow for an incredible amount of possible strategies to aim for the each puzzle's solution. Future planning. Piece set-up. These equally simple skills will be gradually honed to tackle the hardest puzzles. Over a hundred hand-made levels, divided into several specially crafted boards. Daily auto-generated levels for a never ending experience. A color palette friendly for people with deuteranopia and similar visual complications. Several selections of zen music to fully immerse into relaxation. In-game options that allow gameplay speed tweaking, suitable for different play styles. Fully wordless UI for accessibility that ignores language and age barriers. A simple, yet addictingly complex gameplay for everyone to enjoy. Pegs. Once again, thank you very much to everyone that gave their feedback and support that led to this project's creation. And of course, a special shout-out to YOU for taking your time to view PEG .

It is a unique combination of the two modes of play, and has an in-depth and interesting story-line which has not yet been used in WWII computer games – the greatest civilian Uprising against Nazi occupying forces – the Warsaw Uprising. It is a story of the Silent Shadows - forerunners of modern day special forces - paratroopers dropped behind enemy lines to organize resistance and use diversionary tactics in the fight against the forces of the Third Reich. An appropriate audio-visual setting combined with cover system (an excellent, proven method of game play), the story-line, and diverse settings ensure a dynamic and enjoyable game not only for players familiar with this type of theme, but also those merely wanting casual entertainment. Action Mode Play through an over-the-shoulder perspective gives a sense of reality to small groups of soldiers fighting in the tight confines of a city. You venture through buildings, cellars, streets, ruins and underground canals and take part in seemingly real skirmishes. You have available to use 16 types of weapons, depending on the tactics you choose. You can take cover, give orders to comrades, fight at close quarters, or at a distance - to get advantage over a superior number of the enemy. RTS Mode You lead groups of uprisers that take part in heavy fighting on the streets of Warsaw. You as a leader will have to think strategically and improvise in quick changing situations of battle.

Your decisions will bring interesting twists into the gameplay, as you can heavily influence the conflict and its outcome. You will experience hundreds of intense fights in a brutal medieval meets sci-fi world, where every decision has its consequences. Level up your hero, improve your skills before facing one of many boss fights and get ready for an unprecedented amount of possibilities. Key features Thrilling split screen couch coop for shared experience Rewarding story system bearing vast impactful decisions Intriguing deep storyline revealing an unknown planet Unique game world combining fantasy and sci-fi background Coherent RPG elements for immersive game-play Challenging action packed combat system Different tactical possibilities for co-op and the single player Advanced skill set supporting player cooperation Intriguing Story Dig into the forgotten past of the world. Uncover the conspiracy behind the events that take place as you play. Let sides of the conflict make you understand their motives for fighting or disregard everything and everyone and just make the world burn. The story of the Last Oricru is complex and it may take multiple different play-throughs to make all pieces of the puzzle finally click together. Impactful Decisions Massive decision tree in which your decisions lead to different outcomes, affecting story, characters, game endings but also visuals of levels or even the gameplay flow. Every action, sub-quest or life taken can affect your reputation with each faction. There are multiple ways to play through The Last Oricru and no right or wrong decision. Your decisions will shape the fate of the world, literally. Challenging Combat The combat is easy to learn but hard to master and aims to create a tough but rewarding experience. Melee and ranged weapons with unique attack animations and secondary abilities, shields, techno-magical items, weight management and upgrade system offer a wide range of customization for your play-style. You will encounter various mass fights, in which you can prove your loyalty by aiding your comrades in arms but also fight your way through unsuspecting and surprised enemies, as you travel through a number of distinct areas of the war-torn world. Be prepared to die... A lot! Couch Coop Invite your friends over or tell your significant other to join you in your adventures! The Last Oricru is designed to make co-op a unique experience, so for example you can find new fun ways to defeat bosses or reach special secret areas. The Classic RPG character stat system also enables each of you to specialize your character differently, so you can reap the benefits of role diversity: become beefy melee tank and protect your archer friend or become a duo of mages and use one of co-op only spells to wreak havoc among enemies. You may also want to be a pair of swordsmen, hacking your way through enemies should-by-shoulder. It's entirely up to you and your partner-in-game. Previews Niche Gamer “The concept of combining Darksouls and Mass Effect feels like a great choice.” Desconsolados “…it (the demo) has left me wanting more.” “GoldKnights is creating something ambitious, interesting and with personality.” RpgSpainCom “...a Souls-style game but more accessible to all types of players” Mein-MMO-de “Being a mixture of sci-fi and the Middle Ages, The Last Oricru creates a very unique atmosphere that is at most comparable to the Elex series by the German studio Piranha Bytes. The game mechanics can make The Last Oricru a feast for co-op fans” Zing.cz “The premise of the story and, among other things, the peculiarly sarcastic humor intrigued me so much that I really started to look forward to the final game.”","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'Polish', 'Russian', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Czech']","['English', 'Czech']","“The Last Oricru is a unique new entry to the souls-like genre that offers a significant amount of player agency to shape the world around you.” 8.5 / 10 – TechRaptor “The game provided a decent Souls-like experience, with fun combat, great co-op, and an engaging premise. Best of all, this was baked on top of a satisfying branching narrative system that truly delivers on player agency. The Last Oricru will likely surprise players, but expectations should be kept in check.” 7.5 / 10 – Lords of Gaming “The Last Oricru as a title of the Soulslike sub-genre, makes an effort to stand out from other games by betting on its history.

Would you survive being kidnapped by bandits and held for ransom? What if you were stuck in a dark dungeon, fighting beasts alone? Would your bloodline continue on? Would you Survive, or would you be just another victim of great beasts of lore, lost to ancient history and forgotten forever? There's only one way to find out...

This shows a reflection of reality where people wear masks to hide the darkness in their hearts. Although the story itself was written years back, we are wanting to share it with others in a new way through a visual novel format. We hope that this emotional story will touch your heart and be one that you remember. If you could change the past, would you? Isabella, your classmate, is someone you were never close to but someone you certainly noticed. One day however, you notice that Isabella stopped coming to class. You start to discover how important you were to her despite never even having a conversation with her before. She has left you notes in a particular way that takes you on a journey where you discover her past and meet the people who were important in her life. Be careful with what choices you make as they can impact the events and direction of the story. Isabella She was so pretty, with her beauty being indescribable. Her flawless smile was like staring at the clouds. She was the correct path among thousands of wrongs. She was always herself, not perfect, but the image of perfection. She was someone that you looked up to the most. Despite always seeming so delighted and happy though, you already realize just how miserable she was, even to the point where she was contemplating cutting ties to life and choosing death as her final escape. Camil You met Camil because Isabella left her a note too. You don't know too much about her just the fact that she is your classmate too. Maybe she has some beauty hidden under those cap and glasses. Dallen She is Caroline's mom. Dallen's work usually puts her at risk and that is why her greatest fear is that one day something could happen to her leaving her daughter alone. She is a loving mother and a very smart woman. Caroline She's the reflection of the purest innocence. She is a happy child even though she hasn't lived a perfect life, because she has lived hard moments in her short life. She has a fantastic imagination, which often results in her losing herself in her own dreams.","['English', 'Spanish - Latin America', 'German']",[],"“Although this may not mean much since it's only January but this is my favourite game so far this year and I'm absolutely satisfied as a Kickstarter backer.” Kuratsu “It is more than just a romance game, the character captivates you and makes you wonder about a bunch of the actual world, like your fears and also puts you to reflect about life and youth.” Wei “The pastel UI and the music box make a very good job of giving a false sense of security to the player; and even though I knew what was in store for me, 'that' scene still really hit me.” HippoTheCat",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1788840/header.jpg?t=1653949816,https://panditastudio.com/porcelana/,https://panditastudio.com/contact/,panditastudio.contact@gmail.com,True,False,True,11,7012.4,Pandita Studio,Pandita Studio,"Single-player,Steam Achievements","Casual,Indie","Casual,Visual Novel,Anime,Drama,Dark,Psychological,Emotional,Story Rich,Choices Matter,Indie,Violent,Multiple Endings,Sexual Content,Narration,Singleplayer,Choose Your Own Adventure","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1788840/ss_09208a5d86a27aa3918bb6100817f42a94bba9d9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653949816,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1788840/ss_d2b790f653de3359a623ecb8122e21e7009d3761.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653949816,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1788840/ss_5efc542894183b0244f693daf995d487e3bfc0ae.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653949816,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1788840/ss_8e7bb4eccca7d721493be1f47c1aef9f6910ebcb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653949816,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1788840/ss_57265fe38c949c923135bee6a31c11a2326a1ed4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653949816,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1788840/ss_9da64777b96867e1dcf945df26301566b3c953a4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1653949816",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256862348/movie_max.mp4?t=1638757876

907672806b3e46edabcfd4be98b4ffa5,Terra Invicta,"Sep 26, 2022",49,8470,Everyone (E),35.99,0,"An extraterrestrial probe is detected approaching Earth. Unknown to humanity, an alien force has arrived in the far reaches of the icy Kuiper Belt and has begun mining a dwarf planet to prepare for an invasion. With Earth’s nations unable to unite to address the alien arrival, transnational groups of like-minded political, military, and scientific leaders develop covert channels to coordinate a response. With the aliens' motives uncertain, factions emerge, driven by hope, fear, or greed. You will control one of these factions. The Resistance works to form an alliance of nations to mount a coordinated defense Humanity First vows to exterminate the aliens alongside any who sympathize with them The Servants worship the aliens and believe they will solve all the troubles of the world The Protectorate advocates negotiated surrender as the only means to avoid annihilation The Academy hopes the alien arrival heralds the opportunity to form an interstellar alliance The Initiative seeks to profit from the chaos and destruction Project Exodus plans to build a massive starship and flee the Solar System A distant anomaly, a mysterious crash site, and a spike in reported disappearances. Could this truly be humanity's first contact with extraterrestrial lifeforms? As your field agents investigate sightings and your scientists race to explore new fields of research, you will slowly learn the truth behind the alien arrival. From early sightings and UFO crash sites to rampaging alien megafauna and robotic armies, it will rapidly become clear that the other six human factions are not your sole competition. Throughout the game, illustrated events will present you with difficult choices as you investigate growing alien activity on Earth. Uncover the mystery of the aliens’ origins and motives – unless, of course, you are Humanity First, and all that matters to you is extermination. Terra Invicta has a global research system that creates opportunities for both competition and cooperation. Shared scientific advancement unlocks private engineering projects. Factions can choose to focus on private projects, at the cost of weakening Earth as a whole and ceding influence over global research direction to other factions with different priorities. Left unchecked, factions like the Servants or the Initiative may steer the world’s efforts toward developing methods of social control, rather than propulsion or weapon systems. You begin on Earth as the head of a shadowy organization devoted to your chosen ideology. The aliens are coming – soon – but your first enemies (and perhaps allies) will be other human factions. Lead a faction united by ideology, rather than a nation defined by territory. This is a stark change from most strategy games – in Terra Invicta, you will not paint the map with the colors of some chosen nation. Instead you will rule from the shadows and compete with other factions for control points representing a region's military, economic, and political leadership. Geopolitics is your sandbox – unite or break apart nations as best serves your ends, while using those under your influence to conduct proxy wars against the other six factions. Earth’s regions are modeled in detail, from educational levels and unrest to GDP and inequality. Gaining command over regions with great monetary wealth and military power can allow you to implement your will on Earth, but the war for the Solar System will not be won without also securing regions containing space launch facilities. Enact your will through a council of politicians, scientists, and operatives sent around the world (and even into space). The starting abilities of these councilors will improve through gaining experience and acquiring control over powerful organizations like intelligence agencies or wealthy corporations. A veteran commander may make the perfect choice to lead a tactical team under the council’s direction, while an experienced diplomat works to secure the funding needed to resist the alien invasion. Seek out like-minded populations and politicians and take actions to convert followers of opposing ideologies. Public opinion is modeled along multiple axes – the Servants’ alien worship and the Protectorate’s advocacy of negotiated surrender may largely align in terms of support or opposition to the aliens, but events that show the aliens can be defeated have the potential to convince followers of the Protectorate that resistance is a realistic choice. Terra Invicta bridges the gap between our modern-day world and the vast interstellar empires of other space strategy games, asking you to take humanity’s first steps in colonizing our Solar System, where over 300 asteroids, moons, and planets in constant motion create an ever-changing strategic map. Take your faction beyond the confines of Earth, building space stations to act as shipyards and fuel depots, constructing mining stations to acquire advanced resources, and establishing bases to serve as research or construction facilities. Terra Invicta zooms into the strategic geography of the Solar System, presenting space not as a series of isolated stars that you order units to move to and from, but rather a rich and varied landscape of asteroids, moons, dwarf planets, gas giants, and other celestial bodies creating texture and tactical opportunities at every turn. The expansive map is constantly shifting as celestial bodies orbit the Sun. This means your space stations and forward operating bases are constantly moving as well, forcing you to plan accordingly and adapt to the evolving circumstances – your colonies among the Jovian moons could find that a once-distant alien military outpost or Initiative privateering base has suddenly become a close neighbor. Terra Invicta explores what might be – how colonies on Mars might function, what plausible engines could power our spaceships, and the nature of how space colonization and warfare might proceed. Players may find themselves establishing a mining base on the asteroid 16 Psyche after noticing it is rich in metals – and then learn that in our world NASA is planning The Psyche Mission for the same reason. Exploring and eventually colonizing space will require access to many resources: water for life support and propellant, metals for manufacturing, fissiles for nuclear drives and weapons, and more. At the start, you’ll have no choice but to acquire such resources on Earth and suffer the high cost of using rockets to escape Earth’s gravity, but over time you’ll increasingly choose to instead rely on asteroid mining and other means of securing local supply. Spaceship design in Terra Invicta draws from the best of scientific speculation and hard science fiction. You can design your own ships, selecting from an array of weapons, drives, and other modules to place on a variety of hulls, ensuring each ship has the right mix of fuel capacity, maneuverability, and other capabilities. Tactical combat is built around a realistic simulation of Newtonian physics, where momentum and maneuver in 3D space are just as important as the firepower your ships carry. Fire missiles and use point defense cannons to destroy incoming projectiles; build up momentum then swing hard to bring the enemy into your firing arcs; or grapple with the difficult decision to retract radiators and sacrifice heat dissipation to achieve better armor against an incoming enemy barrage. Terra Invicta is built with modding support in mind, and much of the game is accessible to modders without a coding background. We hope that the Solar System setting and geopolitics simulation will provide a useful framework for modders to realize their own creative visions.","['English', 'French', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Japanese', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'German']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1176470/header.jpg?t=1664772072,https://www.pavonisinteractive.com/,https://www.pavonisinteractive.com/phpBB3/viewforum.php?f=4,support@pavonisinteractive.com,True,False,False,90,34662.05,Pavonis Interactive,Hooded Horse,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Workshop,Steam Cloud","Simulation,Strategy,Early Access","Strategy,Simulation,Grand Strategy,4X,Historical,Space,Sci-fi,Sandbox,Management,War,Tactical,Military,RTS,Action,Singleplayer,Moddable,Real-Time with Pause,Real Time Tactics,Atmospheric,Early Access","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1176470/ss_5465982b6689959f0a4dcef51dda735a2728afec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664772072,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1176470/ss_6b31ea5adbef76ae5483fa4012a2990fd1a4b893.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664772072,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1176470/ss_9e7f682cc351f4ad0dd81157d4d19ee90d70a97a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664772072,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1176470/ss_23901e1ddd9ac9bd1a6036a3db6f37fc9d2f0bf7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664772072,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1176470/ss_a46e46703aac3acb869ac42709b4fda7ae017089.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664772072,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1176470/ss_06804a7acc5c52c50bef4030b924636c2a41fa37.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664772072,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1176470/ss_a53dbc3766a48d4ff9d4753de16c6ff9440c5aaf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664772072,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1176470/ss_209de2752bfd13c5327f52c0de530cec2d33729a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1664772072","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256907700/movie_max.mp4?t=1664203459,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256852624/movie_max.mp4?t=1664203463"

But it feels very good when you ace a boss fight with just a bit of health left over.” 85/100 – Softpedia “Retro inspired first person shooters don’t come any more stylish than KINGDOM of the DEAD.” 80/100 – Finger Guns",https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/header.jpg?t=1657884290,,https://fs30.formsite.com/505games/KotD/,,True,False,False,33,17645.12,DIRIGO GAMES,HOOK,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support","Action,Adventure,Indie","Horror,Indie,FPS,Survival Horror,Hand-drawn,Noir,Action,First-Person,Adventure,Underground,Singleplayer,Comic Book,Stylized,Action-Adventure,Combat,3D,Gore,War,Violent,Historical","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_438ba3f46ca4b84e0e402325c27e0f4e444a523e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_e8db17cc1394a4724b8152a6564b310ee1d8ada8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_3fe48053228c39820e54ba29195a99cfca4e8954.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_04c980de8cae5ab561280dfa334572c02c169ca9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_1d1ce1fee71f250c35e6ea1e8c8e472f6ec68771.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_e8cd11a8c80a01570c3b308c4b7f9bde8db04325.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_d657d6f50b67c654acf59af8799ea408e89e55b2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_0d71959c5371f5f2e1c14c634b392a3c01cbd759.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_0f54d6cc1712b8b1dd00431b5cccd18b80f01f01.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1547380/ss_3c1fcbfd9fc631aec66e93d58b9f3a2f8ef14e2a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1657884290","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256888512/movie_max.mp4?t=1653577917,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256873238/movie_max.mp4?t=1644515283,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256840884/movie_max.mp4?t=1624962256"

Travel alongside Europa, a brave warrior determined to enter the mechanical giant Talos and stop the corruption within before it swallows the world in darkness. Battle through tainted creatures, meet charismatic musicians and uncover the truth behind the curse that robbed the land of all color. Many have tried to venture inside the twisted depths of Talos, a dormant fortress where several civilizations have settle over centuries. And, after losing everything she held dear, Europa has nothing holding her back from attempting what others could not achieve. As a noble fighter who refuses to be bound by the curse, she must enter the castle, find the source of corruption, and return the color once and for all. This adventure is not for Europa to face alone. Inside the giant, she befriends Apino, a cute floating bear who seems to possess magical abilities that can restore color and replenish the health of his allies. He is also able to shield his companions from the multiple dangers that roam Talos’ hallways. While exploring the castle, Apino can cleanse the corruption around Talos and shoot a variety of projectiles that can destroy dark crystals and inflict damage: A fist that punches upwards when conjured. A blast that travels along a surface until colission A cyclone that returns to Apino like a boomerang. Use the elements to your advantage to travel the map dynamically. Acquire the elemental armors that were once treasures to ancient civilizations and change on the fly and unlock special abilities to traverse your way: from swimming against waterfalls to traveling underground tunnels or gliding through warm air currents. Harness the power of lightning, water, earth, and fire. Surprise bosses while you switch armors, perform strong halberd combos, and exploit your foes’ weaknesses to pave your way through the heart of the shadows. Music is all but the soul of the game. Revitalize the world while you listen to a moving soundtrack composed by Miguel Hasson, as well as soothing pieces scored in 432hz by celebrated composers Michiru Yamane (Castlevania series) and Norihiko Hibino (Metal Gear Solid series). Meet these guest composers as in-game NPCs who aid in Europa’s quest throughout the game. Music is the binding thread that combines gameplay and storytelling: collect musical notes and perform a healing lullaby to restore your health.","['English', 'Spanish - Latin America']","['English', 'Spanish - Latin America']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1402120/header.jpg?t=1680118481,http://halberdstudios.com/,,keyrequests@freedom.gg,True,False,False,34,59806.18,Halberd Studios,Freedom Games,"Single-player,Full controller support","Action,Adventure,Indie","Action,Adventure,Metroidvania,Action-Adventure,Exploration,Platformer,Pixel Graphics,Side Scroller,2D,Atmospheric,Story Rich,Female Protagonist,Indie,Fantasy,Lore-Rich,Magic,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1402120/ss_b0a1f66a2484184dda7ad0cc131b79f149b05872.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680118481,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1402120/ss_5917dcfcc016b9d0372a7f76b234428c63ff08b0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680118481,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1402120/ss_d8681a8c857a775b6a27a608f569e52a008da23b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680118481,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1402120/ss_1ae2c94096e7e78f080afe116dfc4f50f98503f9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680118481,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1402120/ss_d9d52813f7eab230ff407d235480591e6be33c9b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680118481,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1402120/ss_c4e7388bac00336e76ff6318a3a0373f5b467691.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680118481,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1402120/ss_13d741931259c0279fc4f0a7e7472d76517e6403.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680118481","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256937976/movie_max.mp4?t=1679937489,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256891079/movie_max.mp4?t=1654959889"

The goal is to complete the level with as many points as possible. The main difficulty is that there are many obstacles for the ball to pass, for example: swings, pendulums, bridges, etc. Your ball can also change the material it is made of and this might significantly influence the route of your ball. One of the main options that the game provides you with is the creation and publication of your own levels. In the game you will find a flexible and user-friendly editor of the levels. Every player can share his own opinion on how the game should look, what should be its design and the level of difficulty. At the same time the players who are playing the newly-created level can rate the efforts of its creator and thus form his rating in the Top Builders List. At the start the player has a certain amount of points that is diminishing all along the play time. There are bonus points on the way to the finish that can help you to reach the top of the rating list. When a player finishes the level with the greatest amount of points he sets the new record of the level. All the records are kept in the list of leaders. A player will also earn global rating points by setting new records in the levels.

Every chapter advances the story little by little, gradually deepening your knowledge of the two heroes as well as Hakuhi.

Chaotic movements from the double pendulum + varied weights of asteroids require intuition and focus. My first published game + characters designed by my son. Hard but addictive. Two great songs. LATEST LEVEL ADDED: GRAB ASTEROID!! Now asteroids fly by from all directions - You must chase one down and drag or throw it into the grinder. Avoid the other flying asteroids which can knock you off course or use them to bang another asteroid into the grinder! Features: • Simple &amp; minimal yet challenging &amp; addictive! • A 99¢ game you can play forever! • Double pendulum game play! • Experience all 3 of Newton's Laws of Motion! • Rocket-powered Tardigrade! You are a mutant Tardigrade - a bizarrely resilient micro-animal that has been massively enlarged via CRISPR gene editing and fitted with rockets and a double-pendulum entanglement beam to mine asteroids. Haul the asteroids into the grinder without grinding yourself and make BILLIONS! Each asteroid will have random rotation and mass(from very light to massive) which makes them behave differently when connected to a moving player. To start, the asteroids are easiest and become more challenging as your score increases. Later sparkling asteroids are chaotic, very difficult and very lucrative.

The elite hacker resistance movement SyndiK8 has unearthed the sinister reality behind Eden Corp’s newest line of robotic products. As one of SyndiK8’s elite operatives, your mission is straightforward: infiltrate Eden Tower, steal as much Raw Data as possible, and get out alive--bringing Eden Corp down in your wake. However, as the secrets behind Chairman Shiro’s new “Promotion” program becomes clear, the reality gets much more complicated. Does it really grant immortality? What is Eden truly collecting? It seems that Eden’s corporate veneer may be just a thin facade for something much, much worse. Built from the ground up for virtual reality, Raw Data ’s action combat gameplay, intuitive controls, challenging enemies, and sci-fi atmosphere will completely immerse you within the surreal environments of Eden Corp. Go solo—or team up with a friend—and become the adrenaline-charged heroes of your own futuristic technothriller. You will put your wits, boldness, and endurance to the test. Active VR gameplay turns you into a controller, with instant reflex access to an arsenal of advanced weapons and cutting-edge nanotech powers. Shared spaces with avatars and motion tracking encourage players to physically communicate through body language and environment interaction. Cool Features Active VR Combat: Utilize your body to dual wield pistols, slash and slice katanas, pump shotguns, deflect projectiles, do gun tricks, or even use your fists in close-quarters combat. Holster up and pull weapons off your body with physical loadout and check your stats on the in-game forearm display. Hostile Takeover PvP : Whatever side you’re on, this fight is personal. Featuring four hero classes with optimized abilities, balanced gameplay, intuitive “joystick” locomotion, as well as stealth and armor powerups, Raw Data: Hostile Takeover lets you battle it out in up to 5v5 matches across multiple king-of-the-hill maps. Duel Mode (coming soon!) also provides a unique 1v1 showdown experience for those who are bent on revenge. Choose Your Hero: What’s your fighting style? Choose from multiple badass heroes--Bishop, the Gun Cleric; Saija, the Cyber Ninja; Boss, the Street Merc; or Elder, the Rogue Hunter --with a variety of advanced weaponry, special abilities, combat techniques, and ultimates. Defy gravity, slow down time, charge up shots, crush enemies, boomerang your blades, unleash deadly bullet barrages, fling enemies into the air, and much more. Deadly Weapons and Defenses: Access a futuristic arsenal of firepower, from dual handguns and pump-action shotguns to iron knuckles and laser swords, as well as deployable turrets and holographic shields for extra insurance. Adaptable Enemies: Battle against swaths of murderous machines, including stealth ninjas, laser gunners, rocket heavies, jumping crawlers, exploder bots, flying drones, charger mechs, ion beams, towering megabots, and more.

All characters are over 18 years old, as indicated in the opening chart. Introduction: This is a text adventure game based on cyberpunk world. Players will play a cartoonist who is engaged in robot cartoon drawing, and interact with maid robot through options, so as to achieve different game outcomes. Background: This is the era of robots and the gradual disappearance of the concept of 'human'. The bionic robot created by the new technological revolution has blurred the boundary between human and robot, and has the intelligence no less than human. Because of its low cost and high efficiency, it has been rapidly applied to various industries, promoting economic development. With more and more social fields in which robots participate, people's excitement about intelligent robots has gradually turned into fear and confusion. A large number of people are unemployed and can't be placed, and robot related crimes occur frequently. The original ethical order based on traditional human society has also collapsed. The government introduced the robot Management Act, using electronic collars to conduct unified management and monitoring of robots, and established the AI supervision department. But all these measures are struggling under the capital pressure of robot manufacturing companies. In the world of cyberpunk, where robots are pushed to the forefront of the wave, the third-class cartoonist who was rejected because of the dissimilarity of robot painting bought an unidentified maid robot as a reference for his cartoon. matters needing attention: **1080p resolution full screen game is recommended for the best game quality experience** **The second half of the game adopts a variety of artistic styles for artistic expression, which is not the wrong material transfer.

d993bbb24b9245d988208038c599f294,Railed Up,"Jul 6, 2023",51,0,Everyone (E),4.19,0,"Take part in deadly settlings of scores between rival electricity providers, inside futuristic tramways on suspended railways. In Railed Up, everything is upside down. You see the world from below, in order to give a better view of those endless railway networks as well as the oppressively enormous city through which your quest will lead you. It's a multiplayer game for one to four players. A solo campaign will lead Iskhar on his way up the layers of the lower city, while he faces each electrical gang and discovers all the deadliest weaponry of their tramways. Each gang eliminated means having their arsenal at your disposal, a much needed help against what's coming. The tone is very dark and violent, but tries at the same time to offer a dose of offbeat, cynical humor in its dialogues, which brings some lightness between the the ruthless confrontations. The gameplay is 'on rails', literally. You need to operate your tramway along the tracks of each arena, get ammunition as quickly as you can then shoot and destroy all your opponents in order to be the last one standing. Its challenge is based on restricting the player both in his movements since he can only follow the tracks, and his firing which can only be done perpendicularly to the tramway trajectory – except for some special weapons. So the choice of positioning is crucial. The first goal in every fight is to find ammunition, usually in the form of electricity leakages along the tracks, generating bright spheres of concentrated energy. A small sphere will provide you with one unit of electricity, while a large one will give you 5, with a limit of 20 that tramways can store. Leaks will only reappear when there's no more available. Then the actual shooting can begin. The most basic weapon is the missile. Pretty straightforward, it only costs one electrical unit but only deals one damage out of the ten which make your healthbar. Once you have 5 units at your disposal, you may place a mine, which will explode and deal five damage to any enemy who runs into it, or you can shoot five short-range missiles simultaneously. The last weapon is different for every type of tramway but will always require 10 units in order to be triggered; its effects can go from defensive to extremely powerful. The year is 2376. The world is now covered with miles high buildings. You live deep down in the lowest layer with your family, who's one of the main electricity providers of the area. In this forsaken place that the sun just barely reaches, a gang war wages between electrical compagnies. But that's not the reason why our young protagonist Iskhar has decided to pay a visit to his family's competitors. It's because of what they did to him years ago, which still affects his life. Suspended tramways are the main means of transportation between the gigantic buildings which form the lower layers. Their network spreads everywhere, even within the buildings themselves. Many railways have been built by the inhabitants for convenience purposes, or because some hostile encounter lead to the destruction of the regular ones. So some are in better condition than others - which sometimes don't even have two ways, nor proper stations to exit. Apart from the lack of sunlight, those lower parts of the city hardly get any rain either. The only source of water is the endless ocean at its feet, filled with all the waste falling from above. Needless to say, it's not really the most pleasant place to live, hence why everyone who can afford it, slowly migrates towards the upper layer, which inevitably needs to grow even higher, and leaves the bottom more and more desolated. Iskhar is young and reckless. All he has in mind is revenge, but he doesn't realize the extent of the forces he's against. He just jumped into the first tramway he saw and embarked on some impetuous quest, or maybe a suicidal one. His ennemies made him what he is now, and this could either be a hopeless weakness or a strength that they'll regret. While his older cousin Eliace shares his desire for retribution, he's aware that Iskhar's quest won't be quite as easy as he thinks, and he will try to guide him all the way up. Well established among his family of electrical engineers, Eliace has extensive knowledge in many different scientific fields, including the ones relating to weaponry. In fact, behind his intellectual facade, he's no stranger to using tramways as a means of defense. Express Charge - 'You must have run into them before; they stroll everywhere, especially where we don't want them. In addition to their electrical services, they try to pass themselves off as some kind of police officers serving the bottoms, but everyone knows what they are. They prevent people from developing their own energy sources for alleged security reasons, and force them to subscribe to their services. Of course they pretend to be impartial by making sure everyone pays their bills, even those who have subscribed elsewhere, but their exorbitant fines are outright extortion.' D-tone Eight - 'They live near the water, at the very bottom of the city. Sorts of gigantic sewers. They get their current from tidal changes; not the most efficient but it seems to work out for them. They're mostly overload providers. It's a modified electricity that everyone injects through cables into the eyeballs - I hope you stay away from this. I wonder if people are still using them for less twisted electrical needs.' Light Circuit - 'Those guys, I don't know if there's still something human left under their circuits; they even replace parts of their brain with electronic devices. But in any case their services are effective, although a bit expensive. Oddly enough, these are the least creepy of the three suppliers, except that they consider themselves like a caste rather than a company. For my part they make me think of a cult.' The universe tries to blend different science fiction subgenres, including steampunk, tech-noir, dystopian fiction, etc. Graphics are entirely in 2D, using a mix of realistic shadings and textures with some hand-drawn elements - such as the characters' portrait animations. As for the musics, they're orchestral compositions with a distorted sound, in order to add a dramatic effect to the fights while reinforcing the impression of unease and technological nightmare.","['English', 'French']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/header.jpg?t=1688649390,,https://twitter.com/AbsorbReality,absorbreality@gmail.com,True,False,False,14,10021.72,Absorb Reality,Absorb Reality,"Single-player,Multi-player,PvP,Shared/Split Screen PvP,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Remote Play Together","Action,Indie",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/ss_bb3d54b873c916794df6fd28d73baf3d7917a654.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688649390,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/ss_88231d8214461ee9cbfabc9efe60e118fd74406e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688649390,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/ss_71422250baa2f38097810d15bc89b5c83554d395.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688649390,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/ss_504730f67bc64b504832edcc80f624e0a2920058.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688649390,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/ss_e57baa406edb88fb47bbda9dd0b6e456049f49bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688649390,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/ss_d6718f92b25a472471037b6867266b9b7c055e44.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688649390,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/ss_60c61e9f235774d381e3334aa54a0e52cd87323b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688649390,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/ss_1fb33f674e0916d1130424c15c738107a08e9da1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688649390,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2383660/ss_c6a84698e6340f80635af85252a70f8a787c4abc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1688649390",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256952119/movie_max.mp4?t=1687448635

He joins a group dedicated to learning about spirits, yokai and the occult in order to find new material for his next story. But, there is one urban legend that especially catches his eye – the tale of Kurokami-sama. Domaru's curiosity takes hold, but he quickly learns there's wisdom to the phrase 'be careful what you wish for' when his investigation leads him to the real Kurokami-sama. She spares his life on one condition – he must hunt down the other yokai, slay them, and bring them back to her. But Kurokami-sama is as capricious as they come, and she won't hesitate to send Domaru to an early grave if he makes even a single mistake. Subject to the whims of a powerful yet beautiful creature, what will Domaru do? Serve her eternally, or fight for his freedom? Gameplay Kurokami-sama is a powerful being, shrouded in mystery, who has cursed you with the duty to hunt the otherworldly monsters that lurk in the dark corners of Tokyo. On your journey, you will meet a wide variety of supernatural entities from creatures of urban legends to beasts of ancient folklore. During your hunt for these monsters you'll have access to a parameter called 'spiritual energy' which can be used to read minds or launch devastating attacks. The player will have to decide when to strategically use this limited ability to overcome the obstacles and battles that you may face. Complete your tasks and you'll be rewarded, but Kurokami-sama can be as cruel as she is beautiful. It would be unwise to get on her bad side. Kurokami-sama's Feast is an adventure visual novel with mystery and danger around every corner. Players will explore the streets of Japan in search of clues to find the monsters that live among us. The cast of characters are brought to life with stunning artwork accompanied by a heart-pumping original musical score; with a memorable story by writer Takahiro, known for his work on Akame ga Kill, Majikoi, and Release the Spyce. The player's choices have real consequences that affect the outcome of the story. Will you find the monsters and please Kurokami-sama, or disobey her will and face her wrath?

Take caution, however, and remember to keep your jetpack fuel topped up–you’ll need it to get back to your Space Rig safe and sound!

Whether it is salvaged debris floating in space, advanced and rare tech from wrecked ships, or scavenged goods from asteroid surfaces, you’ll want to snatch it all up! Recycle and refine it to produce valuable goods that will net a tidy sum on the Trash Exchange, and spend it to upgrade your kit. You’re not alone amid the wreckage. Alien bots patrol most sectors of space nowadays and they’ll be drawn to you as your operation expands. You’ll need a steady aim, impeccable defenses, and an upgraded armory to protect your Space Rig from the dangers of these foes. Survival depends on your ability to defend yourself! ...and more!

The game features gameplay that is very basic, yet difficult to master. In every level you are given a color code, that you will have to reproduce. Every hexagon will take the color of the circles around it. Click on the circles to change their colors, and the hexagon will take the color that most of the circles have. If the colors are equally assigned, the hexagon will turn back to black. Level packs Level pack 1 - Easy as 123 Level pack 2 - Say hello to Yellow! Level pack 3 - Stay connected! Level pack 4 - One and only one Level pack 5 - Chain reaction Level pack 6 - SNOW or never! Level pack 7 - Goodbye code Currently there are 7 level packs (besides the tutorial). Each level pack adds new concepts to the game, to keep you on your toes. No reason to worry though, the brain teasing logic and fun behind Color Code is guaranteed. In these levels you will meet buttons like “Locky” (you can’t change it’s color), “Pairy” (comes in pairs, both change to the same color), “Powerball” (the hexagon will have this button's color, regardless of how many other colored circles are on the hexagon) and others.

3e8fd03fcaf94fa7bae012025a6537e9,CARNAGE OFFERING,"Apr 28, 2022",39,1,Everyone (E),11.24,0,"Developed by Futurtech, Carnage Offering is a brutally enjoyable and intriguing surreal shooting experience. Diverse monsters, incredibly destructive and upgradeable weapons, fast-paced movement, and carefully tuned physics provide the arcade experience that forms the basis for intense first-person combat. The dark humor in the dialogues, the weapon management and the brutality of the fights make this game a new genre of FPS. Story In 2527 in a dystopian world, Jake, an engineer and bounty hunter, travels to the far reaches of the universe through a wormhole. With the help of his friend Roy, Jake's goal is to exterminate the replicator robots that threaten the Confederate planets. Led by Roy, Jake has no choice but to accept the missions planned by the alliance and even do the dirty work. Between missions, Jake comments on the orders in front of the holograms of his future enemies with disillusioned remarks. Weapons Oh, by the way, did we tell you that there are weapons? Jake is not a fan of the small spoon. So players need to upgrade their equipment if they hope to defeat the entire menagerie they're up against. Players switch from pistols to Gatling guns and must adapt their equipment to the enemies of the moment. There are 9 different weapons to unlock in this game: Pistol, machine pistol, shotgun, magnum revolver, grenade launcher, assault rifle, double barrel shotgun, rocket launcher, Gatling gun. The only way is to pay in dollars. To do this, you have to kill monsters and complete your bounty hunter missions. You can also buy ammunition and sell it or find it on enemies. Each weapon has specific upgrades that cost a lot of money. For example: a fragmentation grenade for the grenade launcher, nuclear missiles for the rocket launcher or a laser gun for the Gatling gun. You will discover that there is an audio and text description for each weapon. You will learn more about the manufacture and origin of these weapons. Environments Moving from a medieval city to a zombie-infested town, Jake travels to the far reaches of the universe to reach his goal. All levels are completely different and take players on a journey for better or worse.","['English', 'French', 'Spanish - Spain']","['English', 'Spanish - Spain']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/header.jpg?t=1655498485,https://www.futurtechstudio.com/carnage-offering/,https://www.futurtechstudio.com/contact,strider84@live.fr,True,False,False,16,42200.12,Futurtech,Nova's Army,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support",Action,"Action,FPS,Gore,Violent,Demons,Fast-Paced,Shooter,First-Person,Singleplayer,Blood,Sci-fi,Atmospheric,Post-apocalyptic,Mature,Story Rich,Adventure,Futuristic,Difficult","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_825634611a48cb5a7db1eb42fb49338bb10e89c7.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_318d686d7bd3d85174892c1249478b87c8e611f5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_90c6b63a4916ad5a6bcbd77a20692793624bb583.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_6cf638f694ef62262f21db05717fb296baa9ebca.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_2d633e846a5f8fa8adef254f348632829732adcb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_0f1081072953d633feaf36747a58e3972b810ed1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_a50bfea0f521cc0e2e59c2844d999343d30b34fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_26ef00dd328694ae85bd54c9d23412068bcf3bbc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_dc37e524f1e904dc8eccfd0506987706a572ba2f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_9389162a4ce6e7331bec69d03ab75b048b703f76.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_18588a139d6da4d80f56e31eed0b1d592f61cc96.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_28d7d8c065203f65145e1804123702de28958d7b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_29f8a37707a61c0f00c857e362df3dba16ebfd59.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_376a5d3b5be874ceb28d335f68220fb101bdb0ce.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_66e6f789aface640ed3597f9c6a1e9c766d6779b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_8b3026b2a80fef02a1a4fab81ea433624227178d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_926658e0eb958b44b5f09916202c8f181fa12800.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_cdc96d432efa971faadb185ae161c14b24596291.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_19353ce533e4eae11e4d6bff9375bcde3444fcab.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_edc3bad8e51e07b399fc790ec0efbc10c94269c3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_37f927f7f015141e6b190f664a2cdfcc786e5c93.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_daa06a99ca6e9c3134dc4a2ae5a0f9ee58c04ace.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_6fe5f2cf543e5c4f057c5f835cb5f9694770f8bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_070237270e7e047dc407f2387d814913aa40ce68.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_f0f41b43dd29635902de6135761b5c449fe4431b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_e1639dfe665f3863392365e870dc9626cd0a93ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_15490fb24ed79b4c1f8a36edd3803253997ce726.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_b0f6e9a99f3890f2f803283e562f5d4b80ac2f9d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1756180/ss_7c9ca902efeac9b239685238b7dd5c7568795999.1920x1080.jpg?t=1655498485","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256875615/movie_max.mp4?t=1645808409,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256850995/movie_max.mp4?t=1639888246,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256876096/movie_max.mp4?t=1646156874,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256865782/movie_max.mp4?t=1639887853,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256856489/movie_max.mp4?t=1635071832,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256867426/movie_max.mp4?t=1641182992"

Your objective is to clean up more than 100 files to finally access a part of the game corrupted by a panoply of bugs and viruses. The main character can propel himself, jump, sprint, shoot, pilot a ship, use grapples, swim at any speed and in any direction as long as he masters the key combinations wisely. You can play at your own pace in normal mode or activate the speedrun mode and try to get the best medal. A ranking system is also present to compare your times with those of players around the world.

In the role of a legendary Omega pilot, you'll engage in deeply simulated, hex-based space combat as you explore and complete missions in over 40 distinct sectors , while acquiring new ships, and upgrading them with hundreds of equipment options . EARLY ACCESS VERSION With detailed combat mechanics, faction-based strategy elements, multiple game modes, and countless ship upgrades, the EA version already offers a complete 'roguelike' gameplay experience with tens of hours of gameplay. At the time of launching EA the available missions are mostly procedurally generated, and a lot more content – including the full handcrafted storyline, and new pilot skills, ships, and equipment – is planned, to create the truly epic experience we are aiming for. (So if your main interest is in the story, you may prefer to wait until full release before playing the game.) Tactical turn-based space combat Use your tactical skills on a hex grid with fast-paced ‘one-tile-per-turn’ mechanics inspired by traditional roguelikes, but with a fluid, modern feel. Deep Simulation Realistic combat mechanics simulate damage to individual ship components. Each weapon, engine or utility item can catch fire, leak power, and acquire many more status effects. You will also need to manage heat, energy and fuel levels by making smart movement and equipment choices. Non-linear exploration Freely traverse a procedurally generated solar system with handcrafted elements. 4 main factions and 7 minor factions pursue research, trade, construction projects, and other goals irrespective of your actions – though your actions affect their success or failure! Flexible development Use your growing reputation and influence to acquire more powerful ships and equip them with countless weapon and utility combinations. Acquire new piloting abilities through a flexible skill tree, and research relics to unlock new powers and equipment. Immersive setting Uncover a rich, branching narrative threaded with endless procedurally generated stories in a detailed setting inspired by hard sci-fi. (NOTE: The main narrative will be added over the course of Early Access, and is not yet available. The Early Access version of Relic Space is built around procedurally generated missions.) Real Space Movement rules based on actual space physics: motion in a straight line is free, but turning, starting or stopping cost energy. It is the year 2612 and the galaxy lies in ruins. You are a member of Omega, the elite pilot wing of a community of survivors known as the Order. Originally an elite military organization set up to protect posthumanity from high-impact, low-probability threats, the Order is a community of genetically engineered supersoldiers with a fierce sense of tradition. After failing to prevent the devastation known as the Fall, their core aim is to recover lost knowledge and rebuild civilization.

Magic Borderless is an application to help gamers play games on fullscreen windowed without the ugly borders. Windowed mode gaming lets gamers instantly switch to other windows in the same computer while they are dead (because they suck) or waiting on loading screens, without having to see Windows go ape nuts when alt-tabbing. Some games even crash when alt-tabbed, but Magic Borderless is here to prevent that as well! The app tries to help you be as lazy as possible and do the work for you as much as possible... for free*! *(Well, after you pay for the app.) Extra helpful features are also added to assist gamers when it comes to managing windows on their monitors, such as Ninja Mode where it allows you to hide and mute a window for... um, science! Automatic Game Detection When you run your game on windowed or fullscreen mode, Magic Borderless can detect it without you ever have to manually add them every time. If this feature is enabled, it will ask you if you wish to apply the borderless magic. When the magic is applied for the first time, all you have to do is set your game to run on windowed mode once. Magic Borderless will take care of the rest automatically every time the game launches. You can also set to apply default configurations to all detected games without ever asking you! Improved Borderless Algorithm There are different ways to make a window borderless, but all of them often has trouble resizing window properly or suffer from graphical errors. Magic Borderless has improved code to combat these issues for you and will work on even more games! It has the highest compatibility list of all borderless software available! Customizable Additional Magic Besides making your favorite games borderless, you can also set the game to run on a specific window size or simply maximize to your monitor's resolution. If you wish to keep your Taskbar up, you can also toggle it to make sure the window does not hide the Taskbar. Some also prefer their borderless windowed mode to behave like real fullscreen apps (minimize the window on alt-tab). For those weirdos, you can set the Alt+Tab behavior to minimize the window. Ninja Mode: Instant Hide and Mute By pressing [Alt] + [X], you can activate Ninja Mode on your currently active window. This will not only completely hide them from taskbar and among opened windows, it will also mute that particular window only! This feature is also available to Alt+Tab behaviors for any games you configured! Cursor Lock Some noob developers forgot to add cursor lock to their games on windowed mode (or they believed it is how they should behave). If you don't like this behavior, no worries! Magic Borderless can lock your cursor to that window OR the monitor (for our beloved multi-monitor users). Muti-monitor Assistance Magic Borderless can stretch a game window across all of your monitors so you can it big! The program also provides additional tools like mouse cursor centering and Window-Escape feature to assist you on multitasking! Volume Manager Instead of going through a number of clicks to adjust the volume of your apps, Magic Borderless can help you adjust them reliably through its own UI. You can also change the background volume so when they are not being used their audio volume can be either reduced or muted completely!","['English', 'Korean']",[],“This is literally the only app the gamers truly need!” My brother,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1022230/header.jpg?t=1564691972,,,shielchristmas@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,8087.01,Studio Christmas,Studio Christmas,Steam Workshop,Utilities,Utilities,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1022230/ss_6c40a9f7e9e10182c2d834027c7ae10124648e2e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1564691972,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1022230/ss_efcf15333c9225c18c15dcac18b2431e5eaa6ffe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1564691972,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1022230/ss_1f427e1f2dc4b3cf949ffd8223c51b20efe2396e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1564691972,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1022230/ss_04f09aebdef6c975b1410cf2c7eab3e8b183e531.1920x1080.jpg?t=1564691972,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1022230/ss_64ef22ae493310aa1963167a9af95d11fecbd918.1920x1080.jpg?t=1564691972,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1022230/ss_bd2bfdd3bd0e76f7307238e9cfe54ff83b313231.1920x1080.jpg?t=1564691972,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1022230/ss_aeea3ba2e28fd9db70214bf97171196f00fa2fc9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1564691972",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256741376/movie_max.mp4?t=1548972591

The player enters the shoes of Alex Wake, a young businessman who returns to a Baron’s mansion where he stayed as a boy. Bearing a deep grudge against the Baron and his family, Alex seeks to manipulate them and their employees in order to lead the family down the path of destruction. Alex can develop dark and complex relationships with 6 male characters. It depends on you, the player, to steer the story towards foreseeable tragedies or help Alex discover the faint chance of redemption. Description A psychological thriller centered on revenge. Homosexual romance between men based on the dark themes of love and hate. Warning: Features dubious consent/non-consensual sex between adult men. Develop relationships with 6 male characters (5 romantic interests) of various age, personality, and physique: the austere eldest son and heir apparent, the cold and silent second son, the pure and innocent youngest son, the kindly family doctor, the impeccably polite butler, and the social butterfly friend. More than 20 in-game events with sexual content. (Note: Does not include sexual depictions of women or minors.) Individual stories for all romantic interests.

Yet everything seemingly remains routine and unchanged in 'Ashgrove Park,' a stately mansion surrounded by a vast forest. But then a man arrives to disturb its tranquility—a man who spent his boyhood at the estate has now returned after 10 years. The Baron Edenic—the master of the house—and his four sons, the doctor, and the servants greet him with wariness, joy, or unfamiliarity. A story of discord and destruction between and the people of the mansion and a man who hides his thirst for revenge beneath a calm demeanor. Does the fall await beyond Eden?

For when he was a teenager he saw his family being attacked by zombies in the village where he lived. Cesar, who at the time of the attack, returned from his daily adventure in the forest, witnessed everything from afar and vowed to avenge all the zombies he encountered along the way in memory of his family. For that to happen, he needed to equip himself with a powerful and deadly weapon to exterminate the zombies with just one blow. So he decided to use the sword inherited from his father for another journey. Time goes by and Cesar is now young, leaving to take his revenge. For his survival, he must seek food, health in the middle of the forest. Having been alone for many years, Cesar cannot relate to anyone, because in the game there are Indians, but out of fear, they run away from Cesar, when he approaches, because of his brownish manner. The young man has only one goal: which is to survive and kill all the zombies. The game contains: Store, Map, Character, Enemies, NPCs, Hunger, Life, Volcano, Village, Coins, Rain and Temperature. Shop: contains everything you need to survive your adventure. Map: You will find enemies looking for you, NPCs roaming the map or in villages and coins scattered everywhere. Character: Cesar, a young man embittered by the death of his family. Enemies: Zombies that for unexpected reasons will try to kill you.

A sudden power outage has plunge the streets of this town into darkness. As the hands of supernatural forces manipulate your reality, you seek a means of escape. After what seems like an endless struggle, you discover what seems to be fragments of your reality. By collecting these fragments from the depths of the Realmverse, you can slowly piece together your escape from this mirrored prison. The Realmverse is a constantly-changing maze. The Maguntsche Demon is a dark entity with only one goal in mind. As you explore the Realmverse, this demonic creature is out for your blood and will do anything to stop you from collecting the reality fragments. Your only line of defense against The Maguntsche Demon is your flashlight. This tool has limited usability and could potentially anger the entities of the Realmverse more. It is important to use your environment and flashlight wisely to your advantage. The archives provides additional stories and tales to explore within The Maguntsche universe. The Maguntsche Archives is updated with new volumes regularly. Pieces of these stories can be discovered as documents found in both Maguntsche Mode and Superior Mode. The location of these entries is randomized each play-through to provide additional replay-ability in completing the various volumes of the archives. Superior Mode provides a unique set of challenge-based gameplay elements and online leaderboard integration. Players can stack up to three different challenges. These challenges provide additional bonuses to the player's score. Superior Mode is endless, and features a variety of different levels to explore. New challenges are to be implemented in the future, with the possibility of new environments to explore in the future as well. The future of Maguntsche: Chapter One Remastered is bright. We are planning various free content updates to provide new features, gameplay, and quality of life improvements. In the first months of our release, we provided two major content updates.

This game is a sequel of the original classic dinosaur hunting video game, Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter. It’s an authentic hunting simulation where you track and stalk your prey. Careful and thoughtful consideration must be taken during the hunt; to survive you'll need to know your preys temperament and mannerisms, and just like in real hunting, you need to be aware of your surroundings (you don't want to be caught upwind of a T-Rex or you'll end being lunch). Remember you're not hunting deer, you're hunting dinosaurs. You’ll visit huge, beautifully rendered and realistic 3D environments, each with their own unique Eco systems. There are pristine beaches, dense jungles, pine forests, muddy marshes, rocky plains and deserts to explore. Environments can be used to increase the odds of a successful hunt. Players can follow trails and track animal footprints. Awareness of wind direction is important since some dinosaurs can smell you. Using stealth and land elevation will give you a sound advantage over some of the more vicious dinosaurs. Choose between a high caliber rifle, sniper rifle, a silent crossbow or tranquilizer gun, which puts your prey to sleep instead of killing it. You can also carry sidearms. Some of your equipment includes a handheld Gadget, which includes radar and GPS satellite positioning to make tracking the beasts easier, Cover Scent which masks your smell and numerous other goodies, which will prove indispensable for your hunting adventure. There is a wide variety of different dinosaurs to hunt each with unique behaviors and intelligence. Every dinosaur in Carnivores has realistic, advanced AI logic, so from species to species , each will react differently to you. Some dinosaurs will flee if they see you, while others will become enraged and attack.

624ece4a3e7f493ab38800fd6ab84a94,Mutiny!!,"Oct 20, 2017",54,2,Everyone (E),9.99,3,"Mutiny!! is set in a world of fantasy, and adventure. A realm where airships can sail among the clouds as well as the sea, entering the flogiston to journey to other planes. There’s treasure spread out over many planes if you’re brave or curious enough to find it! At the bottom of the sea or within mysterious ruins, protected by curious animated guardians. The world of Mutiny!! is in every way ‘fun’, silly and sexy as you imagine! Everything begins with you sat at a table, adjusting your clothes and blowing a kiss to the cute little Fairy you’d spent the afternoon with. The ‘Captain’ comes in; a haggard and tired figure. Still, they might make for some interesting company, seeing as how captains have ships, money, and go on exciting adventures. It becomes readily apparent that she’s on her last legs, announcing that the Pirate life is hard, and her luck is drained to the final dregs. The Navy is on her tail, and her ship is being scuttled with debt. Of course, you’re happy to offer a little ‘Stress Relief’, but she confesses she hasn’t a penny to her name. Hell— she probably couldn’t find gold in a chest. You sigh and shrug; you’ve always been particularly lucky. The Captain seems awfully enticed at the whole prospect of some life-changing luck. The little conversation is brought to a screeching halt by the sound of Navy boots stomping their way through the building next door. Not an issue to you of course, but the ‘Captain’ seems to be missing some facial coloration all of a sudden. Then with a snap of her fingers, she’s up and out of her seat with a brand new purpose, tossing her hat onto your head. “Must be fate!” she announces pleasantly, and while you’re still trying to figure out what’s going on, her jacket is thrown over your shoulders. There’s a scampering, a yelping of alarm from one of the patrons, and then silence. Once you’ve got the hat off from over your eyes, the ‘Captain’ is nowhere to be seen. Skipping past the Navy isn’t an issue for you, and the real culprit is long gone. Nothing for it but to find this woman’s ship and get things sorted out. … Or at least give back the hat and jacket… despite how totally cool they are. Once you get there, you find a mismatched crew of helplessly inept girls who weren’t even a hundred percent sure they were pirates the whole time. The crew announce that it’s unlikely the ‘ex-captain’ is coming back. She gave over the hat and jacket after all! That’s all it takes; its proof! You scoff at the ridiculousness of it all, intending to drop the hat onto one of the girl’s heads. She gasps and scrambles away, begging you not to put that evil on her. It takes you a while to come to terms with it all, but it seems you’re in charge now! First step, re-name the ship. Second step? Find a way out of debt. Third step? … We’ll figure it out somehow.

Flora is then fourteen years old. She and her friends, Freyja and Ramia, discover the city where the inhabitants of the Academy of the Federation of Mages reside. The young girls learn from Albus the joys of learning the trades that are essential to the smooth running of the walled city. But on the other side of the continent, a threat is coming their way. The climate changes dramatically. The inhabitants of the city prepare themselves for a growing and confusing threat. Learn spelling in a different way while having fun! For young and old alike and ages eight and up. ' We are Julien (head of the company Futurtech Informatique) and Brigitte (retired school teacher). We live in the Vaucluse and are currently developing an educational innovation. We have created a spelling video game. The first of its kind, 'Pago's Forest' allows you to improve your grammatical spelling through the discovery of a 'heroic fantasy' type story. The first part of our trilogy 'The Forest of Pago: The Dragon's Revenge' is available since August 2019, it focuses on the present tense and subject/verb agreement. The second installment 'The Forest of Pago 2: Remembrance of Ice' is scheduled to be released in the second quarter of 2021, for the past tense of the indicative. A third part will finally deal with other tenses and modes, the future tense and the conditional and subjunctive modes. This second part of our trilogy will bring significant improvements: the help boxes are more digestible but you will be able to learn more thanks to a new tab, the grammar tab, which can be consulted at any time in the story, as is the case for the lexicon. You'll also discover a new gameplay system: during battles, characters take turns to face each other and suffer attacks that decrease their life bar. Thanks to the collected stars, you will have access to an additional gameplay 'Adventure Mode' which allows you to control Flora's character to help her in her quests.

All of a sudden you found yourself in Hell and you want to get out. The only way seems to lead through the 14 levels of Hell. Each level except for the first one is ruled by a boss holding the exit portal key. Since you are in Hell, the level bosses happen to be the Hell's most important fallen angels such as Lucifer, Mammon, Dantalion, Furcas, Zagan, Belphegor or Asmodeus. They are very strong, yet each of them possess a vulnerability you might want to discover. Make your way out through all of the levels of randomly generated infernal dungeon, get the keys, food, weapons and other items from dead monsters, overcome bosses and escape that horror! Try to beat the high score in the global Hall of Fame. This is a survival turn-based dungeon crawler game resembling the rogue-like classics from decades ago. Game controls Use arrow keys, WASD keys or a game controller to move your hero and attack nearby enemy creatures. Click locations to set spell cast target or to shoot arrows (with a bow equipped and some arrows in your backpack). You can equip armor items to your hero's body. The equipped items wear when used. The backpack weight does matter. It affects the stamina and health params significantly. Make sure you watch the health and stamina all the time, because with zero health your hero will die forever. When entering a new level (also the first level), some items are hidden by default. This is especially true for the level map and the exit portal. You need to find the red scroll to uncover the hidden properties of the level. Such a scroll is unique and it is in possession of a random opponent. Game features Permadeath (if your character dies, the game is over) Turn-based gameplay with an intuitive interface Procedural level generation Limited inventory where the weight matters a lot Hidden items and traps You must hunt for food to survive More than a hundred of different creatures Enemies can steal your inventory items Attack and shooting accuracy based on weapon condition and luck Weapon wear and repair Stamina, mana and health recover by using potions, scrolls and food only Retro styling with a smooth camera movement No tutorials, no guides, no hand-holding Your global rank is shown throughout the game Game progress is saved automatically and also manually - from the menu.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/header.jpg?t=1680267485,https://oshikuru.com,https://oshikuru.com,oshikuru@oshikuru.com,True,True,True,14,48972.08,Oshikuru.com,Oshikuru.com,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Leaderboards","Indie,RPG",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_dd794485cd77f034934f003046076bf0068ea22c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_8e8e80b0d241a69e710d6b03b00886d56ae7ed8a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_2840ec14dd117f3ef2197ba6d15c1582615b5cb4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_132af2b227d9f7c67cb6902f23c0403e3a3be195.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_b7b1dd07a9e2c3ef94ab22522e070b1f361b6a21.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_0cb3baa14d8f6ea69bdcea0dc8341e63ec43dc9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_1324b2018bbf7c7a7c4169d5b2fc1a3d1a778b2f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_5ec871279c908dfd4abb3680e5651cb6c0c79229.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_b123be5555699594308b74f2349fa7fa0937feda.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2260050/ss_1362151ff4a4ae5bb90af494474cae44cd69cb9f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1680267485",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256925307/movie_max.mp4?t=1673780861
52ee9ba59dba4f5e990ed9019c4586c0,The Game of Annie 安妮的游戏,"Jun 12, 2023",56,0,Everyone (E),8.79,0,"Why this game? It's an indie game, developed by enthusiasts. You are an excellent player in front of the screen and have played many excellent games. However, for this game, as it is the first time for the developer to develop a project, it is inevitable that there are many deficiencies. I hope you can understand. Getting your understanding and support on the screen is the most valuable experience for me. Thank you! What kind of game is it? This is a third person action shooter game. Support for custom character size, support for costume change, use guns and bows for long-distance combat, can also use cold weapons for melee combat, with some training elements. Enemies include monsters and humans, as well as AI teammates. What is the setting of the game? An unknown virus has infected the world. Most countries in the world have been hit by the virus. Many people have been displaced. After infection, some patients will become manic and aggressive, which makes the transmission speed of the virus faster and faster. Many organizations and institutions have united to concentrate their efforts to fight against the attack of the virus, but due to the rapid spread of the virus, some organizations and organizations have collapsed. The heroine's husband is part of a group working on a cure for the virus, but because the virus is growing so fast, the group must move to a safe area so that work on a cure can continue. Before the vaccine development organization moved the research site, each team member was allowed to bring a family member with them. Because the heroine and her husband had a daughter, so they decided to take her daughter Anne to the organization, so the couple decided to let her husband take her daughter first to the safe place of the organization. The heroine and her daughter Annie said, 'Let's play a game. You and your father first find a safe place to hide from the monster, and then let your mother find you. If your mother finds you and finds you very safe, then you have won the game. Father and daughter left in a transport plane. The heroine had to walk to the new, uninfected area like the other survivors. But before she reaches her destination, she loses contact with the research organization and her husband and daughter. When she arrived at the institute's new location, she found that the research organization had been overrun by infected patients. After losing contact with her husband and daughter, the heroine is left to survive in this post-apocalyptic environment on her own. Three years later, the heroine heard the news. Rumor has it that the vaccine research organization has not been completely dismantled, and that they are still working on a cure for the virus. It's just been hidden for a while to be safe. There is also talk of the research group taking survivors in a nearby city, but they will leave after a month for a new safe zone. The heroine believes that if this information is true, then she must get to the location of the research organization and find her family before it leaves. So the heroine begins her journey. How is the game played? Step 1 Explore During the course of the game, there will be day count, and players need to reach the most marginal city within a month after the game starts. Each day will have 12 hours of daylight during which players can choose to explore their current city. The level map read during the exploration is random. The weather is also random. While exploring, you may encounter enemies or monsters, who may be armed thugs or infected monsters. Resources can be collected during combat, which can be used to make items or ammunition. Step 2 Defend When the day runs out, the player can no longer explore. You have to go into night mode. In the night mode, different things happen, in the defensive mode, the player has to defend the defensive zone, in the defensive zone you can fight with your teammates, the monster will attack multiple times, first they will destroy the defensive area, enter the defensive zone to attack the player, if the defensive offensive is destroyed, The player can repair during the interval between monster attacks, and continue to hold the area against monster attacks until the end of the night. In Escape mode, you need to escape under cover of night. Get to a safe place in as short a time as possible and build fortifications in the safe place. Join the survivors in holding the fortifications against the enemy until the end of the night. Step 3 Develop The experience gained after combat can be used to create new weapons, or to improve skills. Some skill points can increase the player's physical attributes, increase physical stamina, or carry more items and ammo.

Out of sympathy, you offer your home as refuge for a while in exchange for minor servitude (it is a big house, after all). They happily agree. What will happen as the incubi get comfy?

TADO has classless progression system, as you level you gain skill points you can spend to gain access to a wide variety of different skills. Along with combat you can, craft, fish gather and explore both land and sea, and you can do it all together. Whilst traditional experienced based levelling is important in TADO, you are free to invest the experience you earn in any of the many available statistics giving your character access to different skills, equipment and crafting opportunities. Want to wield a great sword and cast dark magic? Specialize in the Occult along with Great Weapon fighting and crush your enemies with your power. Perhaps you're more the protector, preferring to keep their friends safe with your heavy armour and shield? Invest your skills into the Protection and Heavy Armour and keep your body between your enemies and those that would harm your friends. Maybe you don't know what you want to be and you just found a rare skill gem that allows you to shapeshift into a great bear to crush your enemies? Well spend your saved points in Druidism , equip your new ability and get right to it! TADO also offers other more peaceful ways to earn coin and experience including transporting goods, gathering, crafting or even fishing. TADO features a naval system allowing you to acquire ships and sail the world (with a crew of friends if you have one!) be you a trader buying and selling goods to earn that extra coin or a mighty hunter seeking rare sea creatures for the epic treasures. Playing through the story will see you setup with your first ship and sailing between various locations in the world in no time. PvP experiences are available and optional , including event based activities you can sign up for and compete for valuable rewards. TADO isn’t another aimless open world game that just drops you in the open and sends you about your business, there is a core story which you can play through at your own pace, introducing you into the world and setting you up as an adventurer before you make your own mark on the world. TADO features plenty of solo-friendly content along with some harder dungeons and zones which will require you to bring your party or guild to overcome.

The game tests your experience in gaming (and more broadly, gaming community), while allowing you to join others and build your answers together. Gameplay Once you join or create a match you will spawn as a character with a random question appearing on the display. Control your character and type each letter in squares on the ground (case/space insensitive) from left to right (you can start from the middle). If you don't know the answer at all, ask the internet. Once you finished, step onto the count icon to check if the answer is correct - if it is, the next question will be randomly picked. Answer all the questions and you will beat the game. Contents The questions vary and are of the following types: - Recollection of game's events, places - facts; - Quotes of characters you ought to recognise; - Correct a sentense so the statement is true; - Guess a game by it's features; - Retranslate — guess what a translation meant in origin; - And others.

776e04f053204a4192a946d68fe03001,Carotic - Academic Version,"Mar 8, 2021",51,0,Everyone (E),0.0,0,"Carotic is a top-down 3D couch-co-op hide-and-seek game for 2-4 players. Each player plays the role of a car in a very busy city. Their task is to drive like the other NPC cars while trying to identify the other players. In order to gain points the other players must be destroyed by dashing into them. The player with the most points after a set amount of time wins. HIDE AND SEEK This is just the core gameplay of Carotic as described above. The players' goal is to find the other competitors and dash into them resulting in points for this player and destruction with a short respawn timer for the other. Dashing NPCs does not penalize the player apart from revealing them because of the particle effect and speed up that they gain. REACH THE GOALS In addition to the normal game mechanics there are circles of particles that spawn randomly on the map. Players can drive through them to gain additional points providing a common incentive for the players to group up on one point which allows for more options to destroy the other players. DESTROY THE TOWN Evolved from a previous idea – the chaos mode – in which all buildings on the map were destructible. Similar to the REACH THE GOALS game mode this one has the additional quirk that there is always one random building which can be destroyed by dashing into it. Destroying buildings is rewarded with points which again, creates a common incentive for the players to group up around a key point on the map. KRAKATTACK If you can’t guess it from the title of the game mode, KRAKATTACK features a kraken which is attacking the town. The players can dash into its tentacles to make them retreat into the water. The monster will also destroy players if it slams on them. There is also lightning and thunder that will strike the ground randomly and if a player is too close to the point where the lightning struck, they will get destroyed. FREE FOR ALL RACE Is completely different from the other game modes. Players race against each other on a different map - no hiding, no seeking, just racing. In addition to the dash, the players can select events which they can trigger to gain an advantage over the other players. They can destroy buildings to create shortcuts, let a bus drive and destroy all cars in its way, drop a crate from a crane and spawn a boat that jumps onto the street to destroy everything in its way and more!",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1524810/header.jpg?t=1615223159,https://www.marckletz.at/Carotic.html,,kletzgames@gmail.com,True,False,False,0,57733.96,Marc Kletz,Marc Kletz,"Multi-player,Co-op,Shared/Split Screen Co-op,Shared/Split Screen,Full controller support,Remote Play Together","Casual,Free to Play,Indie,Racing","Casual,Tabletop,Local Co-Op,Racing,Auto Battler,Hidden Object,3D,Cartoony,Minimalist,Top-Down,Driving,Free to Play,Indie,Stealth,Controller,Vehicular Combat,Local Multiplayer,4 Player Local","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1524810/ss_3982afa451d6184e103fb33a5653e9136e1ad0d9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615223159,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1524810/ss_6d9fd7b895ef58941ef8a72ca0ded56c7a84f9ee.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615223159,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1524810/ss_4e4cc053183a6abc042b8ad8e3a1a13bf1db34f8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615223159,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1524810/ss_c08f12e237a32adb12b0fc02e7deea1232810cf1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615223159,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1524810/ss_26a4ba42c3327bc0c617d7ad6b9b17d6da988fb1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615223159,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1524810/ss_a68502a519c51f405c47cd2c2f1912e47422795b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615223159,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1524810/ss_fa0a6b2f9e5e3a286b609bae7674a364038e2144.1920x1080.jpg?t=1615223159",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256824038/movie_max.mp4?t=1614447003

6bd934c608ce4faab40184d8fec31a09,Embraced by Autumn,"Aug 24, 2021",62,1,Everyone (E),18.99,0,"Marcel is the illegitimate son of the famous actor Georges de Saint-Rémy, a celebrated virtuoso on the stage, and a notorious rake with a penchant for sleeping with other men’s wives. Owing to his father’s seedy reputation and his own meek, socially awkward mannerisms, Marcel is bullied relentlessly by the other boys at his Parisian school, who seem determined to make his life miserable. At the beginning of autumn in 1896, Marcel’s brigand of a father becomes embroiled in a particularly salacious scandal, which is widely circulated in tabloids across Paris and beyond. Fearful for her son’s welfare, and desperate for him to have a respite from their family’s continued drama, Marcel’s long-suffering mother pulls Marcel from his school, and instead chooses to send him to her older sister’s school in Myennes, deep in the French countryside. There is a catch in this seemingly innocuous plan, however. Marcel’s formidable aunt, Albertine, owns an all-girls’ establishment, which has never before admitted any male students. To attend his aunt’s school, Marcel is bidden to dress and act like a girl – which he does, albeit, begrudgingly. Marcel never much fit in with his male classmates at his Parisian school, but he’s similarly fearful that his female classmates in Myenes will also shun him. Uneasy and afraid, Marcel expects only the worst when he arrives at his aunt’s school… Which is why he finds it so very surprising when, rather than being treated with scorn, his new classmates instead seem rather fond of him. During his stay in the countryside, Marcel meets four girls who express an interest in him: the quiet, inscrutable Luce; the fiery troublemaker, Claudine; the elegant pianist, Celine; and the class dunce, Mirabel. As the autumn months pass, Marcel grows closer to these four girls – but which one will he develop the strongest bond with? That is up for the reader to decide. 200,000 words of text (approx 8-12 hours of reading) Four love interests with wholly unique routes Detailed character artwork An entirely original soundtrack A crossdressing protagonist Scenic depictions of the French countryside Happy endings!",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/header.jpg?t=1651948295,,,ebihimes@gmail.com,True,False,True,20,43552.34,ebi-hime,ebi-hime,"Single-player,Steam Achievements",Casual,"Visual Novel,Casual,Anime,Romance,Historical,Cute,Multiple Endings,Story Rich,Text-Based,Singleplayer,LGBTQ+","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_712d6ae8ba477faf604449d87404ca100d0a88e2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_7769559c368c5f5cec7919f09230ecf1c7217013.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_f203fb8a560e0e43336e274bc625d736f53cebe8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_a92a8ed2542a73f4618be1af0c322a30f24f03ff.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_cfb0835dedc4f98b4ed1c9ab9e9ec1c897087734.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_4c91054e85070564a3fa6bd9d8ca47e09d88b532.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_30f2f76b240286e4dd555b5b436dee85d3f35f15.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_affd5432775f0ff5e225863c9f7e21279d30ea42.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_9a428086a39cd38360786a3283384bbf28ec2d38.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_9c4e3da6336e7180652692dd75afdee84d000002.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1639920/ss_96cfa2d66d84990fa44da913832b27c578b535e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1651948295",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256838684/movie_max.mp4?t=1623951364

Jude is left with no choice but to escort Philia to her destination, doing his best to protect her from harm and teach her how to survive in this harsh world. Together, they must traverse the hostile wilderness, avoiding threats both mechanical and human. The whole time, Philia insists she's going to become human someday. What awaits Jude and Philia at the end of the road? Can humanity really be saved, or is it already too late...? CHARACTERS An Android Who Dreams of Being Human Philia 'If I become human... I can save everyone. I think.' An android girl discovered inside an ancient replicator capsule. Ever since she opened her eyes, she's been fixated on finding a way to become human. Philia has a bright, innocent personality and zero real life experience. It's up to Jude to teach her how the world works. She's curious about everything around her and occasionally charges in without thinking about the consequences. She also has a natural affinity with AI, being able to understand them on an almost instinctual level. A Wandering Courier Just Trying to Get By Jude Gray 'I have to protect you somehow, and shooting down threats is the only way I know how.' A man who makes his living as a traveling jack of all trades. His knowledge of technology and engineering means he gravitates toward more specialized jobs, for better or worse. Jude's mind is always on survival first and foremost. He doesn't allow himself to be influenced by emotions or any abstract sense of duty. An avid gun enthusiast, he often gets so wrapped up preparing his gear that he loses track of time. A Nobleman Working to Revive Humanity Willem Grosvenor 'I have a dream. One I've harbored all my life.' This mysterious old man claims to be working on a project to take the world back from the Machines. He has access to highly advanced technology that has kept him alive for over 100 years. After contacting Jude via a drone delivery, Willem offers him a king's ransom to retrieve and deliver Philia. He's only ever seen on video calls, making his actual whereabouts a mystery. An Android Seeking Her Father Delilah 'He's the one who taught me everything I know.' An android rescued from a gang of bandits, who appears to be the same model as Philia. She's been treated badly, and now has a cracked-open head, a missing leg, and a multitude of other injuries. She was separated from the man she calls her father, and is desperate to find him again.","['English', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Japanese']",['Japanese'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2510770/header.jpg?t=1695704425,,,vausa@product.co.jp,True,False,False,22,16846.57,VisualArts/Key,VisualArts,"Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Cloud","Adventure,Casual,Simulation","Adventure,Casual,Visual Novel,Simulation,Anime,Emotional,Linear,Singleplayer,Violent,Gore,Cute,Post-apocalyptic,Dating Sim,Psychological Horror,Story Rich,Robots,Nudity,NSFW,Hentai,Sexual Content","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2510770/ss_fb12baa8254c05553b8075d69d85b7339f35abd2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1695704425,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2510770/ss_41b3c2452dd7dd3ee2e9d3a155eb4ac0803669d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1695704425,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2510770/ss_eb160a55c65cab856db595d93fa1a59ed1441f6b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1695704425,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2510770/ss_b823228e3bda41217fea4753dc7c67f00eb88686.1920x1080.jpg?t=1695704425,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2510770/ss_dcf0cc970412ce5255163b2e42479b4b3e7762a2.1920x1080.jpg?t=1695704425,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2510770/ss_5bcbc9c4f84c0e0fd88bf90ae92e819d1eadf8d0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1695704425,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2510770/ss_b55b8be49bca5112cb7d480fad1feab08ba7790c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1695704425,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2510770/ss_055594a17addbd7dbf076ba27445e8a7f99c3418.1920x1080.jpg?t=1695704425","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256964378/movie_max.mp4?t=1695258579,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256964379/movie_max.mp4?t=1695258584"
2e284894bee1487b8f0078cd1cd73b5f,Soul Reaper,"Sep 30, 2020",46,0,Everyone (E),19.99,0,"Soul Reaper is a turn-based RPG that rewards careful planning and meticulous strategy. After surviving a psyche-splitting attack from The Midnight Council, players take control of the Soul Reaper as he quests to rebuild his army and become whole once again. By defeating monsters in combat, users can reap the souls of their enemies and allocate them to serve several unique purposes. Souls can be: Organized into 3x3 battle squads to fight in combat. Fused with other souls to boost a creature’s XP. Devoured by the Soul Reaper himself to advance his own stats. Smithed into loot pieces that both the Soul Reaper and his troops can wear. Slotted into equipment to add or enhance attributes. With many ways to divvy up your souls, it’s up to you to decide how best to utilize this vital resource. Scour the land in search for treasure to help you on your journey, and unlock new abilities on the overworld by bringing bosses to their knees. Regain your emotions by slaying the sentient Reaper Fragments, and defeat The Midnight Council before The Vault comes crashing down with you inside it. Soul Reaper draws inspiration from both classic and contemporary RPG titles. Some games you might be reminded of while playing are: Pokemon: Once you're hooked on collecting souls, you'll wanna reap 'em all. Diablo: Loot with more stats than you can shake a '+50% stick-shaking' stick at. Final Fantasy: Side view turn-based combat, just like the old days! Castlevania: Aria/Dawn of Sorrow: Slay monsters, get souls. Repeat. Features 80+ Creatures to Reap and Collect. Encounter unique and expressive monsters throughout The Vault. Arrange your creatures in up to nine squads, or slot them into loot pieces for extra bonuses. Have a few souls you don’t want? Smith them into items, or devour them for quick XP! Explore Vast Landscapes for Treasure. The Vault is comprised of three layers: Volcanheim, Elysium, and Polarus. Each component presents a drastically different climate, with treasure chests scattered throughout each zone. Addictive Turn-Based Combat With Deep Strategy. Exploit type advantages, unit arrangement, and more to turn the tide in your favor. Slot souls into the Soul Reaper’s equipment to unlock more attacks, and command your squads to victory. Fight at Your Own Pace. Accelerate the game’s battle speed up to x3, or outmaneuver enemies on the overworld to avoid combat entirely. Different Fragments, Different Outcomes. The Soul Reaper’s behavior changes based on which Fragment the player selects. Interactions with NPCs are influenced by the shift in ego, and the story will unfold differently depending on how many Fragments the player has acquired. Fearsome Bosses With Exciting Powers. Besting the boss monsters in combat will grant unique abilities in return. Smash rocky terrain with the Balboa, and extinguish flaming geysers with the Elephount! Return to former areas to explore new paths, and overcome obstacles previously blocking your way. Blood-Pumping Soundtrack. Tracks are crafted to fit the style of each region, and the boss theme presents a climactic overhaul of the already adrenaline-fueled battle music.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/header.jpg?t=1601490855,https://www.powerlevelstudios.com/,https://www.powerlevelstudios.com/contact,support@powerlevelstudios.com,True,False,False,5,20144.18,Power Level Studios Inc.,Power Level Studios Inc.,"Single-player,Steam Achievements","Adventure,Indie,RPG,Strategy","Creature Collector,Loot,Strategy RPG,2D,JRPG,Metroidvania,Turn-Based Strategy,Old School,Party-Based RPG,Funny,Choose Your Own Adventure,Dungeon Crawler,Exploration,Turn-Based,Character Customization,RPG,Strategy,Top-Down,Story Rich,Multiple Endings","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_2abda3fa1132898cae0eed791226191812586c08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_e067345e6902492f24ca8db22f431d26e4cc7b72.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_6de0a91acd3892746acc6500ed7a8746fb508cd1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_e9e6f5e915cffe810473870c3228715e5e97802b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_2fa69a2571fb1a70c85a85a8f4d289c57c7b7512.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_a88e4e3d2726ecb21ac09a404421185fe83f1e5b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_1d7b3d38a18b4a0c9a980033a3ecec82a833d052.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_3a7bc63a38d9546a89535d69cf7f542124f82b19.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_efa2ff05150d7fe8c0d0deb81f2c0539e2dc22c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_119f76cdafdbf8c2e3737e7079e141406094de81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_cac05f445ddf551d9959f91953fc7878fcd17ef9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_9b6777a992b37410d95d3621e4020725ccc456de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_e51eb06c2d2fa56089b3120f1244a0d5d2ce06bd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_0b2db738dba4a9dfe31cc2ef1939230d77a44f47.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_870f3a22a295e37168e18d633080703ecb33ac02.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_cef7694f1ef91ab3e8dd16cec9668904faadb668.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_15af62f58171d9ee3b06ebba467fd3a4889cdf00.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_95f44e509b9c8df21f86b46b73258e8f7ffaa024.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_02d0b4be7503dd04662f1f95e403a3cd5e5386a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1163660/ss_288c7ed3c0c3a44bd8ab0e21ae1a924a3716e9fe.1920x1080.jpg?t=1601490855",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256802890/movie_max.mp4?t=1601407514

FPS Infinite is a full free game to introduce you to my ideals: lots of procedural generation, optional VR support and fun! FPS Infinite is a 'Metroidvania' (similar to Metroid Prime) where the enemies, weapons, levels and item placements are procedurally generated. You'll need to explore each unique world for new abilities, which will unlock new areas. Many abilities can be upgraded, but choose wisely -- do you extend your grappling hook or lengthen the time you can be invisible? Your goal is to find the Forbidden Phr00t in each world, which will trigger the world to blow up! You must escape safely in the dynamically calculated time to win. FPS Infinite supports Custom Game Modes and a Speedrunning mode that will automatically calculate time splits. Vulkan is required, so make sure you have the latest GPU drivers! 64-bit OS also required! Binaries are provided also for Mac and Linux, which have been tested to work, but support is low.

Arcade Mode: See how good you are by fighting opponent after opponent and tracking your win/loss record. Message From Developer Hi, I am Josh the developer of Final Slam 2. I would like to thank all of you who tried and played the game, like or dislike it. A lot of the players dislike Final Slam 2 and if you compare it to other full-blown mainstream competitive fighting games and you don't like it, well, your dislike for the game is justified and I understand. With very limited budget and with only one person working on the game (which is myself), as opposed to bigger-sized indie or mainstream companies, I understand that I cannot provide the best graphics, gameplay and most modern features to satisfy the hardcore fighting gamer. Therefore, I decided to make it more of a casual game and focus on the uniqueness of the game that not many fighting games have. And this uniqueness comprises: 1. the character creation mode with speed creation settings 2. Final Slam Season Mode where you can win titles and fight up a league (fight with characters you created as well) 3. the automatically-generated AI fighters in season mode. Other features include the ability to export your fighter to a text string that can be saved and shared anywhere you like. Therefore, it is possible to create an unlimited amount of characters. Some players have had a lot of fun playing the game, but some haven't and others don't even care about what the game has to offer. But anyway, I accept all opinions and judgment about the game and welcome you to try it out at a low cheap price. You can request for a Steam refund if you feel it is not for you. Thanks again.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/header.jpg?t=1510224539,http://tamugaia.com/finalslam2,,steam@otakumaker.com,True,False,False,0,42897.41,Josh Tam Universe,OtakuMaker SARL,"Single-player,Multi-player,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Trading Cards,Remote Play Together","Action,Casual,Indie,Sports","Indie,Action,Casual,Sports,Fighting,2D Fighter","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_67764f6d5d020f40187cee0acf6cd6bd29a6fdf1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_6fc568bb5ee1cc5a08a38bf41b5860fb72a09a2d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_21a93689077d81253024639bd6a31b38b453dd3b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_c463a4f733286f82ecfb0d6d8187439d151a48bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_9fc4ef174817a75e08983824342f95210e4e8d08.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_50a7afc54ba5bfd366fe45385c4554556d539c54.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_6d8771acd74fbbd9ed4fee61a33c269bea17580f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_c9f4b404521b856e902b247277dfb971d73f2ea4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_65d1367d748ea15b0042afaaef6d003c1633d4a0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_0ef5dd0d070359ce5eaa9af4b60ec83889754d95.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/291330/ss_4032ac6fd6df09d229d0d4cd6a1838fc1f6200f4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1510224539",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2032794/movie_max.mp4?t=1447362249

c6bb718eeef84ccbab0c07f25f3b5101,VR Invaders,"Dec 15, 2016",59,0,Everyone (E),17.99,0,"VR Invaders is a story-driven sci-fi arcade shooter, playable with the HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. In days gone by, people could only imagine their perfect worlds. Today, all of humanity can live within its dreams. But dreams sometimes turn into nightmares. THE STORY The year is 2046. Virtual reality is omnipresent. It’s a perfect shelter from life’s hardships - a fully immersive experience. It’s not hard to wonder why some people spend almost all of their life logged into VR. However, not everyone stays connected voluntarily. Occasionally, a software bug or even a virus can prevent a VR user from disconnecting . To save face while extracting the Stuck, corporations often hire freelance hackers that can enter the client’s neural session and reboot it. Those hackers call themselves Divers . Thomas Hall is one of them, and he’s up for an odd job. KEY FEATURES We must go deeper – Engaging story with interesting characters, which unfolds as you “Dive” into a virtual reality program of a future world to save a user that is stuck, and to battle the unforeseen causes of that glitch. Fast-paced action – Become a living bullet hell for your enemies. Blow them to pieces, crush them against the walls, evade or block their shots. The core mechanics are easy to grasp, but using them to the fullest against all the threats will be a challenge. Arcade play mode – Become the best cyberspace diver out there by achieving a high score in the separate arcade mode. Choose from three different difficulty levels, kill drones in a quick succession and shoot incoming bullets to gain combo points. Slow motion power – Freeze time to a halt when you need breathing space. You can take down lots of drones at once, dodge bullets or check that no one’s attacking you from the side. Multifunctional pistol – Gather power-ups from killed enemies to temporary arm yourself with dual blasters and transform your cyber weapons into various more powerful modes, such as a laser or a plasma gun. Various levels – Virtual reality is vast. You will see radically different and gorgeous environments, from claustrophobic and dark to enormously big and bright. Level structure shapes the gameplay. Hordes of droids – Enemies are numerous in quantity and type. Each one behaves differently and demands a change in combat tactics. Uniquely challenging bosses await at the end of each level. UPDATE 2.0 CONTENTS Removed StarForce DRM – The game can now be installed on as many machines as you would like. Introduced destructible level elements – Blast through enemy cover and leave a trail of destruction as you progress through the game. Added the “Survival” game mode – Fight against hordes of enemies and try to survive for as long as you can. Miscellanous – Made various small improvements to performance. The world you’re in may be virtual, but the consequences of its infection can alter all of humanity.

At the intersection of the old and the new world, you are the Commander in this doomsday that marks the fall of the old and start of the new. Crossing this threshold to enter the new world will be a very challenging task. But don’t worry, you are not alone in this fight for survival. Zombiflux: Sleepless War is a modern zombie apocalypse strategy game. In this brand-new zombie-themed SLG game, you can explore the map, expand territories, and battle to survive in a world of rampant zombies and smoldering forces of chaos. As the Commander, you have a crucial mission to lead the Survivor Camp and fight together with other Survivors to live. ▶ Survive the Zombie Horde ◀ While the humankind is falling apart, you will thrive to win every future battle in the doomsday. Build, upgrade, and expand your own army into an invincible force. Zombies are everywhere attacking in endless hordes. This power will help you survive. Survivors also want more than just surviving. They can be as dangerous as zombies. You’ll need the power to fight against them too. Every victory will push you further on the path of survival. ▶ Build Your Base ◀ Survive first to rebuild human civilization. Build your base from scratch to make it safe and stable. When doing this, you need to manage all resources to maximize productivity of the base and enhance the defense system to prepare for future attacks both inside and outside the wall. This is not just any base. It is your home, Commander. Please protect it! ▶ Real-Time Strategy ◀ During a horde attack, you can be ambushed at any time. But no worries, March forward! As the Commander, you need to deploy different heroes strategically so that they can break through the siege of the hordes. Only those with good tactics can survive! Use your strategies to survive in this world full of zombies! ▶ Unite with All Survivors ◀ Hearing 'you are not alone' from someone in the doomsday is heartwarming yet somewhat daunting. Meet other survivors and build an alliance. But remember, choose your allies carefully. A friendly environment and a decent leader of the alliance will help you grow better. Or, you can become the leader yourself to forge a powerful civilization in this deadly jungle. Be careful of survivors lurking in unknown places. After all, human nature is unpredictable, especially in the doomsday when old rules don’t work any more. ▶ Explore the Map ◀ In the doomsday, this vast land is no longer in the hands of human beings. But humankind cannot be chained between those high walls! You need to climb over the walls, investigate, explore, and fight to get more food and resources for the base or even save other Survivors. In this wasteland, you will also encounter unusual challenges. Use strategies and the power of your army to conquer them one by one.

Not graphic in nature, but please be wary if you like to avoid such topics. Story Those who suffer from depression often find it hard to put into words what they deal with, those who have never had true depression don't understand it. Harder still is to notice someone suffering without them telling you, many find out only when it's too late. We all look back and think, 'Is there something I could have done?' If you look hard enough, you can find different choices, but only when you look back knowing what you know now. College, a fun time for some, a bad time for others. All have hopes and dreams, but some demons pull them down to a hole they can't climb out of. Life changes based on the smallest things, and those who suffer can sometimes see a light to help escape the darkness, or be forever wrapped in it. Features [4 unique endings.] [2 playable characters.] [Unique characters and areas to explore.] Small note with minor spoiler This is all based on my experiences on both sides of the isle. Almost no one is ever to blame for choices made by others, and this is not meant to say you could've done something different to stop bad things from happening.

4ce52a628f004b7298e43e81435ae5f0,Space Mechanic Simulator,"Aug 11, 2023",43,8,Everyone (E),14.99,0,"Space Mechanic Simulator is not just another mechanic game where your only job is to fix some parts. All the parts in this game are simulated, which makes the gameplay more immersive and lifelike. You can't simply disconnect a pipe before closing a valve, and sometimes you won't even know what is broken until you check the schematics and diagnose the problem using your tools. All of this takes place while you're floating in zero gravity or in complete darkness while orbiting on the dark side of a planet. Fortunately, you are well-prepared for all of this. Your spacesuit has a powerful flashlight and thruster automation that helps you stabilize when needed. Just be careful not to run low on oxygen, fuel, or energy, as you'll have to fly back to your shuttle to replenish everything. Of course, you could always take a bit of risk and cut it close, but time is money, after all. Naturally, it would be very unprofessional to throw a new astronaut into all of this without proper training. As you progress through the game, you'll unlock tutorials that can give you licenses for new tools and new activities. You'll start with simple mechanical repairs and diagnostics with infrared cameras and sensors built into devices, and eventually work your way up to electric repairs and even programming devices. You can also earn extra cash by learning how to mine for resources instead of having to buy them. Realism and struggle or fun and fiction? This game aims to strike a balance between complex, overwhelming realism and the fun of simplicity and familiarity. You won't be fixing any dark matter reactors or warp drives. On the contrary, many of the devices you'll encounter are based on actual devices used in real industry here on Earth. You'll be measuring electric signals, temperatures, and pressures using specific tools, comparing information with diagrams, and following the link to find the root of the problem. The Beauty of Space As the game takes place in the Solar System, you won't see colorful nebulas, binary stars, or black holes in Space Mechanic Simulator. When creating a space game in our neighborhood, you can't just make things up. Fortunately, you don't have to. The graphics in the game focus on emphasizing the overwhelming scale of celestial bodies as you, a tiny human, fly around them in various orbits. You'll see the light reflected off the planet's surface as it illuminates your space shuttle or a shadow cast by the Moon on the surface of the Earth as you get a different perspective on a solar eclipse than any other human down on the planet's surface. You can fix a satellite that's chasing and observing a comet or fly low above the surface of a gas giant with supersonic winds while recovering scientific data from a broken drone. You can gaze upon the Sun from its orbit or look at Earth from a front-row seat on the Moon's surface. Or simply chill as you watch the famous blue sunset on Mars. Our approach to making space look good in the game was to create an artistic vision of the Solar System that can pass as realistic. We applied 'the rule of cool' while being careful not to go over the top with anything. The result is a game that offers you a unique and memorable experience of our system that will make you want to launch the game the next day and immerse yourself in this strangely magnetic environment from the tiny interior of your spacesuit.

I left the tavern determined to find the mysterious island. Legend has it that countless treasures are kept up there. In this game, you have to jump and climb up using the classic 'rocket jump' technique. But it will not be easy, it will take many attempts, there will be many falls. The map of the old pirate says that unthinkable treasures await you from above. FEATURES Atmospheric graphics and soundtrack High jumps Long jumps Precise jumps Inaccurate jumps Jumping up Falls - - - This game was inspired by Jump King and Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy. - - - 'In shooter games, rocket jumping is the technique of using the knockback of an explosive weapon, most often a rocket launcher, to launch the shooter into the air. The aim of this technique is to reach heights and distances that standard character movement cannot achieve. Although the origin of rocket jumping is unclear, its usage was popularized by Quake.'

His friend fails the test of time and the girl he’s been in love with since forever sees him as a sister with a male appendage. Everything is going to hell until an old man turns up with an envelope inside which is something that will allow the protagonist to “replay” the state of things and perhaps to multiply previous successes. The only thing that the envelope’s owner is asking for in return is the virginity that the protagonist is trying so hard to be rid of. Whether he should agree or not depends on you. - A game from the author of “Sweet muffin” comics. - After completing it you will need to be urgently hospitalized at the nearest dispensary. - Dialogues are choc-a-bloc full of choices that will allow you to feel like yourself to the max. - More than seven endings! (8!!!) - A game for real men: the author is a master of oral skills and draws on colossal virginal experience. Sparse manly tears guaranteed. - 4 beautiful heroines that you can have a romantic experience with or artfully ditch. - Only this visionary novel features the elite “Lonely hearts club”. - All of Roskomnadzor’s morality police have reserved the Gold Edition. Sergey. The main protagonist. A simple Soviet pioneer who is going through tough days at the time of adolescence. At a certain point, he gets his hands on a magical artifact that allows him to face his mates in a new capacity. Lisa. A mysterious ginger girl who was only recently transferred to the school that the protagonist goes to.

The girl is shrewd and has a good sense of humor. Kate. The hero’s childhood friend. A keen student with a temperamental character. She is fanatically loyal to science, full of secrets and sharp comments that wound everyone that picks a fight with her. Serge becomes one of her victims as it turns out his feelings for her are not mutual. Is this a final decision or is there something that won’t let her accept his offer? You’ll have to find out. Matilda. A bright and lively girl. Likes sport, taking pictures, and spreading gossip (i.e. she likes journalism). She is in charge of the school newspaper. She is always in motion and her life is full of events. She is always busy, but nevertheless, she is looking for a good boyfriend, trying to make the protagonist fall in love with her. Alice. A tragic character. A sweet, shy girl in a strange living situation. Serge and Alice have been in the same class since 1st grade but don’t know each other.

Fight or Flight. Here you must survive, using your wits, strength, bravery and cunningness. Grow up from a cub, find a home and mate, have kids and raise them, leave a legacy and rule the forest. Journey through a vast, seamless world filled with the wild carnivores and dormant humongous herds of herbivores as you survive in the forest. You take birth as a cub, weak and untrained for this wild, rampant and harsh forest. There is a chance of your Mother and / or Father being alive with you. As the game is a simulation of the real wild. If you are alone it will be harder for the player to survive initially. Being a child is important as you grow in strength, gain strength quicker when child. Hunt / Forage, find a home and Mate as you grow up with time or quick growth. Mating will produce kids (if done right), if you die during a fantastic battle. Your spirit has the chance to take over the body of your offspring if you have any. This will enable you as the spirit to live longer and continue your stride towards dominance in the forest. (The spirit can only move in the family blood line ). The game has been tried to be as realistic as possible. I’ve tried to imitate real animals in the game from smallest animals to the largest. The traits, statistics and behaviours of each animal is unique, distinctive and are recreated from reality. There is a small story why this game was developed by me personal but a part of the reason why this game to being is to say “Protect our Animals“. Survivalizm is not an empty sandbox. I’ve tried to fill it with reactive AI all throughout the world. In each area, you enter. The AI isn’t just see player and Attack like 95% of games. The AI in Survivalizm: Moves in herd Finds its own food and water Finds mates Protects its children Feeds it children Reacts to player: - Runs if Player is better in strength or is Predator. (FYI) Some herbivores might try to fight back. - Doesn’t care if Player is weaker - Fights if it wants to protect its territory or family. SURVIVING IN SURVIVALIZM In the world of Survivalizm, survival is more than being well-fed and hydrated. Here you must fight off Predators by keeping a keen eye on the tracks they leave, smell around to find any scents and keep your herd together and strong. BUILD YOUR LEGACY Journey through a huge, seamless world filled with danger and opportunity, exploring everything. Find home, get a mate and grow your herd. REALISM Inspired from countless Survival games and the Shelter Series. Take care of your family while Surviving in a realistic forest environment. The game is as realistic as I could try to make it. The references are taken from real animals, everything is researched from websites like national geographic, animal planet, wiki, other sites about animals. Everything has been to the best of effort kept to a realistic fashion: age ,size, weight, movement, fight style, nature of the animal etc. VARIETY OF ANIMALS TO PLAY AS Rabbit - Chital Deer - Red Tail Deer - White Tail Deer - Wolf - Bengal Tiger - African Lion - Black Panther More on the way. GROW UP The animal which is chosen by the player will be born into the game as a cub and the gameplay as a child will govern how strong, fast and good the ADULT will have. The strength and weight gained is critical for an adult animal as Mating, Hunting are directly related to those statistics. DUAL TIER UNLOCKING SYSTEM 1. Unlock characters abilities in game with levelling up with Age and Actions (Actions like running for a long time, hunting, foraging) 2. Unlock Animals as a whole. In the beginning of the game you will start off as the smallest animal available (right now Rabbit). Earn Karma points in game which will lead you to unlock the next animal. HERDS Be a part of the herd. Can player become Herd Leader ? Yes, If you kill the previous herd leader. Then you can become herd leader.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/597920/header.jpg?t=1627217819,http://www.4t2.in/survivalizm,,,True,False,False,5,24335.31,Vishwakarma studios,Vishwakarma studios,"Single-player,Multi-player,MMO,PvP,Online PvP,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Stats","Action,Adventure,Indie,Massively Multiplayer,Simulation,Early Access","Simulation,Adventure,Early Access,Action,Indie,Massively Multiplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/597920/ss_2498aefaec62ee6b67e5294a29a3323ba9ad12de.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627217819,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/597920/ss_a5949f7aabafebc7b0c58524074e3f2b84d9db0d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627217819,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/597920/ss_df785204dfff9a1cec6bb5bb29d15eceeb47bb2e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627217819,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/597920/ss_d8b310740f3932ec86a4a5463a4dc909c2471d4c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627217819,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/597920/ss_c1d4b0ff43b9508d4816f8a2fa695c7f2acdb63b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627217819",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256680167/movie_max.mp4?t=1488911404

A VERY GASSY STORY Johnny is a teenager who hates healthy food. His mother forces him to eat beans since a certain psychologist on TV said that mothers need to introduce their kids to a healthy diet. After eating the canned beans, Johnny discovers the hidden abilities of his organism. Now he commands a very powerful weapon of mass destruction... Hmm... Farts... Through mastering this newly acquired superpower, Johnny aims to win the heart of his long-time crush Monica. However, each and every time it doesn't work as expected. Will he manage to overcome his problems, defeat his worst enemy Greg, and make Monica fall in love with him? It's up to you to find out. LEVELS The game features 6 levels - Bus , School , Grocery Store , Cafe , Airport , and Airplane levels. Some levels require Johnny to fill the room with unpleasant smells without anyone noticing. Other levels can only be accomplished if Johnny causes enough havoc on the premises. Each level has unique conditions for winning. POTENT WEAPONS Command 3 potent weapons at your disposal - Ordinary Fart , FartBomb , and FartMine . Ordinary fart comes in handy to relieve pressure from your stomach, cause havoc, surprise other characters in the game, and even open doors. FartBomb can knock out NPCs at a distance. It requires beans to pump enough pressure into your digestive system. FartMine is more for tactical players who want to get rid of NPCs that walk around in the game through covert operations. Delivering FartMine requires beans too. DIFFICULTY LEVELS I can say for sure that you can win Cuana on easy-peasy and normal difficulties. However, even I - the developer of the game, have no idea if it's even possible to win on Gas Bomb difficulty. You gotta find out that for yourself!",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2205270/header.jpg?t=1669432767,https://awngames.com/,https://awngames.com/,info@awngames.com,True,False,False,0,15408.77,Aleksandre Glonti,AWN Games,Single-player,Adventure,,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2205270/ss_55d4dd32e426a3693ea806ee5029c411b8233e64.1920x1080.jpg?t=1669432767,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2205270/ss_b53014b7d8d8be60d71bc51da87ed8dc5058c0ed.1920x1080.jpg?t=1669432767,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2205270/ss_bf794f2cd4d595a1e4efa8c18f39232e9a16c3f3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1669432767,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2205270/ss_56bb736da984e9979f88c1a8aeadd7fe9b315aa0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1669432767,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2205270/ss_dae8348b4e0e26586fe0d662c3a9dc3f1055be13.1920x1080.jpg?t=1669432767,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2205270/ss_7cc8d76605f43734875befe2ba6d5e765fcfccfb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1669432767",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256913737/movie_max.mp4?t=1668229883

UNIQUE SYMBIOSIS OF MUSIC AND GRAPHICS Dub Dash is a fast-paced rhythm based action game. The tracks are decomposed into diverging game mode segments. The obstacles, tracks and visual effects are all adjusted to the music and in perfect harmony with each song. Dub Dash has a great soundtrack including music from Bossfight and the DJs of Geometry Dash – to enjoy the full experience the use of headphones is highly recommended. UP TO FOUR PLAYER SPLIT-SCREEN MODE Challenge your friends to the ultimate race in this breathtaking split-screen competitive mode for up to four players simultaneously. Who will beat most of the level? Jump in and find out! SEVEN ULTRA CHALLENGING GAMEPLAY MECHANICS Spin your crazy wheel in harmony with the song and keep dodging left and right avoiding obstacles at high speed. Fly like a bird, make hard 90° turns and feel the rhythm of the zig-zag trajectory. The objective for each track is clear: Do you rock the funky road of Dub Dash? GRAPHICAL FIREWORKS Dub Dash offers impressive colorful graphics and effects with a steady and smooth high framerate. Immerse yourself in a hypnotizing psychedelic experience. SKILL COMES WITH PRACTICE The gameplay of each segment is simple but it´s tough to master the levels. Actually it´s extremely hard, almost impossible – but fortunately there´s the practice mode which gives you a save point after each passage so you won´t need to finish the whole level in one try. Memorize each segment of the level and maybe (only maybe) you will be able to master even the hardest levels someday. FEATURES Driving electronic soundtrack Psychedelic graphical fireworks “Easy to learn, hard to master” gameplay All levels split in multiple gameplay sections Gameplay technically synched to the music in the minutest detail Use of all input devices (keyboard, gamepads, mouse – even racing wheels!)

Even people who have no history of seizures or epilepsy may have an undiagnosed condition that can cause these 'photosensitive epileptic seizures' while watching video games. These seizures may have a variety of symptoms, including lightheadedness, altered vision, eye or face twitching, jerking or shaking of arms or legs, disorientation, confusion, or momentary loss of awareness. Seizures may also cause loss of consciousness or convulsions that can lead to injury from falling down or striking nearby objects. Immediately stop playing and consult a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Parents should watch for or ask their children about the above symptoms - children and teenagers are more likely than adults to experience these seizures. The risk of photosensitive epileptic seizures may be reduced by taking the following precautions: • Play in a well-lit room • Do not play when you are drowsy or fatigued If you or any of your relatives have a history of seizures or epilepsy, consult a doctor before playing.","['English', 'French', 'Italian', 'German', 'Spanish - Spain', 'Dutch', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Russian', 'Simplified Chinese', 'Traditional Chinese', 'Portuguese - Brazil', 'Turkish']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/406940/header.jpg?t=1649421115,http://www.dubdashgame.com,http://www.headupgames.com/,support@headupgames.com,True,True,False,30,28057.97,Incodra,Headup Games,"Single-player,Multi-player,Shared/Split Screen,Steam Achievements,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Remote Play Together","Action,Indie,Racing","Action,Racing,Indie,Rhythm,Music,Psychedelic,Difficult,Local Multiplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/406940/ss_3911dfcbd1ede39257f9f4f474d6dc15d3a6f250.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421115,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/406940/ss_eb464c1f230a161de5d9b256681a5cc060d8da94.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421115,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/406940/ss_c8eae961631555654e1f548a323e6a29e8a36aa6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421115,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/406940/ss_446af8b91fee5d5b7452c7e3cbe0052616f2d2e4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421115,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/406940/ss_463d59147457e2bfe4dc4a2b6c66a51230f6dda1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421115,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/406940/ss_f077ba96067d13766ecf2e9dc9ee4447f53119e4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421115,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/406940/ss_d553aeea74d82f74813560a9c17105d5862247bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421115,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/406940/ss_f05aae24afa7a83ff20118e7962243b8cf46709f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649421115",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256657539/movie_max.mp4?t=1453801378

DEVELOPER'S NOTE: Hi everyone. Thanks for checking this weird game out! This game was a very experimental game that I worked on from 2015-2018 or so. Ultimately I think it didn't end up working out as I had hoped, for a few reasons. One of which was this was actually my first game that I made as a programmer, so I was really learning the ropes of Unity as I was going. Also, it's a very weird design, and I'm now thinking the way to go forward with it would've been to make it a real time game - the Rogue-like input mechanism just doesn't work all that well over huge spaces that you traverse repeatedly. Anyway, thanks for checking the game out - I hope that it inspires some new ideas for other designers! You just got sucked into the Omnochronom (Om-KNOCK-Row-Nom), an ancient, mysterious device. Inside the device are mechanical minions, strange characters and spirits trapped there for eternity. Some say that the Omnochronom gives its owner eternal life by sapping all the energy from those captured. Some say it's simply a twisted prison invented by an evil god. Whatever the case, you know you can't stay here long. There's a huge exit door up top. All you need to do is get one of these Key Minions up to the top before you're completely destroyed. You can find weapons, tools, and other treasures left behind by others who have been trapped here before you. Because of a strange temporal quality of the Omnochronom, you can also find things left behind from people captured *after* you, as well. And you'll need everything you can get your hands on, because there are eight different horrifying Guardians, who power up minions, throw you around, destroy your base, and worse. With any luck, you just might be able to ESCAPE THE OMNOCHRONOM!

Players can level up and battle with their Mythlink in hopes to form the best Mythlink Unity ever! So just what is a Mythlink? A Mythlink is a type of monster that players will select when the game begins. Once players have selected a Mythlink, a special bond begins to form between the player and their new friend. This link between player and Mythlink is called a 'Mythlink Unity' and is so powerful that as one of you improves, so does the other. Because of this, players themselves will take part in various strength, dexterity, and brain training exercises to improve both themselves and their Mythlink. Who will you choose? Minorod The rough and tough minotaur Mythlink who uses a mix of lightning and earth based abilities. Galest The goofy ghostly Mythlink, utilizes tricky wind and dark based abilities Urusagi The cute and cuddly rabbit Mythlink. Brings life to the party with sound and light abilities. Mythlinks have 3 stats which can be improved through playing the game. These stats are strength, brain, and speed. Picking the best way to improve your Mythlink stats is key to victory! Strength Helps your Mythlink deal more damage. Strength training includes games which involve punching and using force. Start sweating with training exercises like... Punching Bag : A no-holds-barred fanatic frenzy of you versus the bag! Pack as much of a wallop as you can in a short amount of time. Hit targets for bonus points and experience! Engine Buster : Some of the machines used to power the Mythlink training facility have started acting up! The best way to fix them? Punch them until they work or...at least until they stop spewing smoke. Punch Junction : The most diabolical game in the strength category, punch junction will test your focus, speed, and strength. Stay on your toes as you dodge machine attacks while attacking their weakpoints! Brain Helps your Mythlink learn more advanced moves. Test your quick thinking with... Pile Up : A VR twist on a classic block clearing game. Can you keep up? Don't let any pieces fall out of the box! Speed Helps your Mythlink move and react quicker. Speed training includes games which involve moving quickly. Baller Dodge : There's no fighting back in this 1-sided game of dodge ball! Last as long as you can as an onslaught of objects are thrown your way! Color Blitz : The strangest game of tag you'll ever play! Don't let any of the sporadically moving shapes slip by you. Once a Mythlink Unity is confident in their skills, they can join online and battle against other Mythlink Unities! Both players will be placed high on opposite ends of the arena where they can view all of the action. From that vantage point, players will control their Mythlink and utilize abilities in order to knock out the opposing Mythlink. These 1 on 1 battles will showcase the fruits of all efforts put into training. Each Mythlink has 30 abilities to choose from, most of which are completely unique to that Mythlink!

Few shinobi have ever been able to prepare a dish so exquisite, but legendary shinobi and sushi chef Hanzo thinks that perhaps his students and their rivals are up to the task. He holds a contest to see which of the girls can hone her Ninja Arts best for cooking as opposed to combat. The competition is fierce; the one who presents the old shinobi master with the Super Dish will obtain a Secret Ninja Art Scroll that will make real her most fervent desire. Whosoever can prove her knife to be as suitable for cooking as for combat will emerge the victor, while all her friends and rivals wind up as mere dessert... A rhythm spin-off of the ninja ‘busty brawler’ series, SENRAN KAGURA, Bon Appetit! features cooking battles rather than shinobi showdowns, with emphasis on outrageous humor, delicious food, and gratuitous images of the series’ lovely ladies. This culinary warfare is carried out through an array of rhythm battles, where tapping the correct buttons in time with the beat will rack up combos and determine the size and quality of the resulting dish. The soundtrack consists of a variety of catchy tunes encompassing all genres from jazz to classical, with special Japanese vocal tracks sung by the leader of each faction. This Full Course edition includes all DLC and 22 buxom ninja between the two original PlayStation(r)Vita releases, rewarding players who can overcome the challenge of creating the ultimate Super Dish with a special feast for the eyes as well. KEY FEATURES Rhythm spin-off of the popular SENRAN KAGURA series The infamous, voluptuous ninja series ventures into a new genre as all of the bouncy babes from SENRAN KAGURA Burst and SENRAN KAGURA SHINOVI VERSUS return, taking a break from physical combat to make culinary war instead in this tasty yet truly tasteless adventure. The Dressing Room returns with even more stylish options Like other SENRAN KAGURA titles, the Dressing Room makes another appearance with multiple ways to customize characters’ outfits—but be careful! Peep too much and you risk the wrath of a full-fledged shinobi… Three different modes of play plus online leaderboards Story Mode progresses through the main game, Free Mode allows for customized cooking showdowns, and Arcade Mode includes comprehensive online leaderboards to see how you stack up against your already pretty stacked competition. Includes original Hanzo x Crimson Squad, additional Gessen x Hebijo pack, and all additional DLC Includes both games which were released separately on PlayStation(r)Vita, as well as all DLC in between, now in 1080p resolution and running at 60fps.","['English', 'Japanese', 'Korean', 'Traditional Chinese']","['Japanese', 'Traditional Chinese']",,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/header.jpg?t=1622822524,http://www.hanzonationalacademy.com/skba/,www.xseedgames.com,support@xseedgames.com,True,False,False,43,30431.77,Meteorise,"XSEED Games,Marvelous USA, Inc.,Marvelous","Single-player,Steam Achievements,Steam Trading Cards,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud,Steam Leaderboards",Casual,"Anime,Nudity,Sexual Content,Rhythm,Casual,Female Protagonist,Cute,Singleplayer,Mature,Cooking,Ninja,Story Rich","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_58cdb88b175de168fa7571f4725cc82b75a1241a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_61ceee2065dfa7b1bc431c94bc4b2a47cc80865d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_8269bf39005a2adbb53130883c93910ef4f09ee6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_c49811f7b2b70039e8cecc778d59fd6f7f36928e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_5f0468fb3de42aa590051c90ba2c469d950c5a9c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_fdff100f82560acca66740119d5325f0b4b957f4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_eacdde7612c6ade1a7290d60799af8d66cb0f1a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_89b06ba91365db3cf0e03b9c5b8d8ad74d44b64b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_f90f5c5624321eca954f64eaa8b1093188a38e3e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_c811341fa94e6269e3b268ab28356e909e0fc7b3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_05f1d42e8ee0f7db044ec7117db2875247975794.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_be63ad1c86f4baf2c91090e07f05a0aa95e494d5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_b20b3069ab902ed0f8797b55a5e70c2c7a03ed77.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_3ca1f6751201bffeb8e3d21ac4dc4d09de73abcf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/514310/ss_dd969b7f796d904d6b684324fbb3efdeb0fd514f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1622822524","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256674467/movie_max.mp4?t=1479269508,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256674108/movie_max.mp4?t=1478717968"

Spirited and adventurous, Zoélie is a young girl overflowing with imagination. When her older sister Sofia leaves in a hurry, Zoélie is distraught at the loss of her best friend and storyteller. She goes on a wild journey, climbing to great heights and crossing dangerous waters in order to be reunited with her dearest sister. One of our key mechanics is Zoe's quilt, Sueño. It can transform into multiple items that allow her to explore the world. It also grants her special abilities like distracting animals and using camouflage to hide in plain site. In our world, Sueño also reveals secrets such as transforming the local graffiti into maps and hints. After studying the local customs and mythology, the Development team chose South America for our setting, specifically the Buenos Aires region. We came up with a ton of concepts, fascinating story ideas, and interesting mechanics. The core idea of the imagination of the child being central to the game was the only constraint we held on to during this process. We learned that family is very important to the people of South America, particularly the bond between siblings, so we included Zoélie's sister Sofia as a key character.",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/header.jpg?t=1627910918,,http://scaditgm.blog,,True,False,False,0,11941.86,"Amanda Wood,Anushay Qureshi,Ben Brook,Bernardo Gullo,Brice Morgan,Collin Peck,Courtney Vogel,Dixon Dubow,Gabriel Tobias,Gianna Rockwell,Holly Owens,John Washington,Julia Myers,Julia Nguyen,Kellan Dwyer,Kelly Washington,Kuan Xue,Mackenzie Blackgoat,Maxwell Mecimore,Megan Tkac,Mercedes Khumnark,Michael Mauro,Mike Relleva,Nathaniel Cartwright,Nick Levene,Oscar Painvin,Phillip Corrado,Rachel Howard,Rodney Burton,Sanda Gavriliuc,Santiago Medrano,Stephanie Owens,Taan Tuchinda,Tiffanni Blevins,Tyler Klimek,Vincent Aliquo,Zach St. Amand,Zachary Taylor,Gage Leonard,Cal Eidson,Sammy Suen",Savannah College of Art and Design,Single-player,"Action,Adventure,Casual,Indie,RPG",,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/ss_ee65fcebafe6e9c53a0da44f232e336916b01edc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627910918,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/ss_abbd8df3f5d36110118f65b6a1727bf65072105c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627910918,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/ss_b378ddd5041ef7e7d4225408ad25c1ce62c2df46.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627910918,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/ss_cea4c64157f449642cd6abf4c66839033b0d1d48.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627910918,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/ss_2d1d3189aa662d4095d056db9e3dca84b75e5733.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627910918,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/ss_74f22deaf9cec6b3503eb57bc7853c16eb1fc33e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627910918,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/ss_e4705e0a4c5cd5cf9c8a461d917cfad8ae68a0a1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627910918,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/ss_0f1c9dee509916ac522368e8e7925979a3cecacc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627910918,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1592240/ss_471c80e0ef617c890448464474209431f1156973.1920x1080.jpg?t=1627910918",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256828833/movie_max.mp4?t=1624916859

Sharing is a core concept in SR2 and it has built-in capability to easily share crafts, saved games, and even planets with the community. With SimpleRockets 2, it is easy to get started, but advanced players can dig into technical details if they are interested in the math behind rocket engines and orbital mechanics. Included are 17 different challenges to put your creations to the test. This is actual rocket science! Join us as we enter Early Access and continue adding new features, such as a Campaign Mode. We want to make sure we are building a game that players will love, so if you have suggestions for the game, we want to hear them . Those who followed our work on SimplePlanes know that we are highly responsive to player feedback. We are taking this a step further with SR2 and have set up a Roadmap page to open up our development process and be as transparent as possible. Build crafts by snapping parts together. Choose from the pre-built engines, such as the Mage, which is a powerful kerosene-fueled engine. Or choose the very weak, but highly efficient Ion Engine. Or you can dig deeper into the complexity of rocket science and design your own rocket engines. Choose from the eight available engine types, seven nozzles, and six fuel types. From there you can change engine size, nozzle length, throat radius, and chamber pressure, which allows for endless combinations of engines. Use interstages to split your craft into multiple stages and piece together modular fairings to protect your precious cargo. Launch multiple crafts into orbit. You can dock with your existing crafts to build space stations, moon bases, refueling stations, and more. Take photos of your journey across the solar system with the built-in Photo Library tool. Stretch and shape fuel tanks, wings, cargo bays, fairings, and nose cones with easy-to-use tools that help you create exactly what you want. Resize solar panels, landing gear, pistons, jet engines, etc to fit your needs. Paint your craft custom colors and tweak their reflectiveness, emissiveness, and texture styles. Rocket science is hard, so you might run into the occasional, rapid unscheduled disassembly (i.e. explosion). It happens to even the most experienced rocket surgeons. Might as well embrace it and take advantage of the opportunity to snag some spectacular photos. Easily drag and drop code blocks to program your crafts to log telemetry, automate them, design your own touch screens, etc. With Vizzy, a programming language designed specifically for SimpleRockets 2, you can expand the capabilities of your crafts while learning programming, maths, physics, etc. Using Planet Studio, an in-game design tool, you can make your own planets, stars, moons, and stellar systems, starting with a large set of templates and tools to easily make infinite unique procedural celestial bodies. For the more adventurous, Planet Studio has an advanced mode with many modifiers to add and tweak different noise layers, adjusting the terrain and the biomes, as well as a paintbrush tool to be able to achieve the most complex shapes. Orbits are realistically simulated and support time-warp so you don't have to wait several months to reach another planet. The Map View makes it easy to see your orbits and plan future burns, which you can use to set up future encounters with other planets or satellites. The flight model dynamically updates the drag and lift characteristics of your craft as it changes. Re-entry effects kick in when you're screaming through an atmosphere at hypersonic speeds. Be careful, because the excessive heat can cause those aforementioned rapid unplanned disassemblies. Download from a huge collection of user-uploaded crafts, sandboxes, planets, and mods on our website . Upload your own crafts and sandboxes and share them with the community. Rise through the ranks from a white level builder to a gold level builder and beyond. FEATURES Fully 3D Rocket Designer that allows building anything from basic rockets to very complicated multi-stage rockets, airplanes, rovers, satellites, robotic mechs, etc. Simple to get started, but advanced players can dig into the technical details if they are interested in the math behind rocket engines and orbital mechanics. Design custom rocket engines and jet engines Realistic rocket physics and orbital mechanics. Program your rockets with Vizzy, a Visual Programming Language, to automate basic flight maneuvers. Download community-made mods, planets, crafts, and sandboxes. Includes full controllable astronauts, or space sailors, equipped with jetpacks and a grappling hook. Over 30 parts, including fairings, retractable solar panels, procedural landing gear, RCS, gyro, etc. Highly procedural parts that can be resized and reshaped into endless combinations, such as the resizable fuel tank and the cargo bay. Map View to navigate the solar system that displays predicted orbits and encounters. Fully 3D, rotating planets that support water and multiple biomes, such as desert, grasslands, tundra, etc. Persistent sandbox that retains your previous launches. Online community where players can upvote and comment on other players' content. Several Build and Flight Challenges. Parts support textures, reflections, and custom coloring. Flight model dynamically updates drag and lift characteristics of your craft as it changes. Re-entry effects including visual effects and part damage from heat. The Nav Sphere makes it easy to control your rocket's heading. The traditional Navball (FDAI) provides vital attitude information. Custom Launch Locations allow launching from multiple places in the solar system. Support for saving custom subassemblies. Crafts can dock together in orbit and transfer fuel. Built-in tutorials show you how to build a craft and how to achieve orbit. Time-Warp allows fast-forwarding while in orbit. Ion Engine supports burning during time-warp. Supports transferring fuel between tanks and advanced fuel management such as fuel cross feeds, priority, etc. Performance Analysis window makes it easy for advanced players to see how their craft's Delta-V, TWR, engine Isp, etc are changed as they build their rockets.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/header.jpg?t=1643649063,https://www.simplerockets.com/,http://jundroo.com/about/,games@jundroo.com,True,True,False,0,82708.5,"Jundroo, LLC","Jundroo, LLC","Single-player,Partial Controller Support,Steam Cloud","Indie,Simulation,Early Access","Automation,Crafting,Open World,Base-Building,Sandbox,Singleplayer,Procedural Generation,Space,Programming,Flight,Building,Physics,Early Access,Education,Simulation,Adventure,Action,Space Sim,Realistic,Moddable","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_f2851e4861ec89a1caeafb459e1c51a598349533.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_92257a94efb807020b2803b6076a6c822f6babdd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_1928929a421d4d6e86d4a52eb3ec94bf389398ec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_89bc31eee127040af0e4fbc3b059e1e52f6993dd.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_a8ea81a41809ee0a01e297e62393b1e68d500d81.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_71ec9df80bfba52eac13a0ee49fe6e60d905b3c8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_2fdea813f97639823e4263e75204da07c2925ac0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_e1a90cd74e06ee57ac2df35b876c05a8a3721707.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_784c9a59f08bd1d111ccf84db9306b5901dabf0a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_b2e8d263d42a4b53a16f341274de1de816d681e3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_6139980ace6511d5549bfdcc9a3e378ccc7a8c64.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_537a4dd97a1f75a83f0e92d250f2bf3480d645fa.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_c7d066fd1851c5e84feb703afbd0184c7fd49b02.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_b3eae4d774068eeb12ad748b4c53e725335ee4e8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_e0165eace72655e48f220fbe44d0e616f81cae70.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/870200/ss_368c61e173fc333df9979611989927f8f794e92a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1643649063","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256808184/movie_max.mp4?t=1604542151,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256748582/movie_max.mp4?t=1555866516,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256792191/movie_max.mp4?t=1594301238,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256748301/movie_max.mp4?t=1555606301,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256735002/movie_max.mp4?t=1541774024,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256733766/movie_max.mp4?t=1540935141,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256717825/movie_max.mp4?t=1527429317"

It’s a puzzle RPG spanning 60 dungeon levels with unique scenarios. [Story] 'The Dungeon of Lulu Farea' That is the name of the legendary dungeon said to lead to the demon world. Adventurers set out to take on the dungeon's challenges in search of wealth, glory, and legendary items, only to fall victim to their own ambitions. Today, a fresh adventurer approaches the dungeon. However, this man has no interest in wealth or honor. No, he is after something altogether different...... 'This dungeon has...... FEMALE MONSTERS!!' [Game Details] The Dungeon of Lulu Farea is an underground puzzle dungeon with 60 floors. Monsters lie in wait, doors block your path, and the labyrinth gets more and more complicated... Unlike your typical RPG, this is not a game in which you battle monsters to raise your level and force your way through. This is because all of the game elements are 'limited.' Defeated monsters never come back, and the strengthening items, keys, and money you receive are all limited. It takes brains to get through this dungeon. Which route will you take, which enemies will you fight, which doors will you open...? These judgments will determine your fate. Repeatedly make good decisions and aim to conquer the dungeon! -Select your difficulty setting: Normal for the regular player, or Hard for those looking for a grueling challenge. -A help system for those who get stuck. Three levels of help to choose from, designed to provide a boost while keeping the game balanced. Two of the help levels may be used an unlimited number of times. -Includes a scoring system. This allows you to play for the highest score possible. [Basic Controls] * This game requires a keyboard.

becd72c54f3f41c18e67af2633c90cc6,Hexaverse,"Aug 17, 2018",46,0,Everyone (E),4.99,0,"Hexaverse is a turn based, 5X ( eXcavate , eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate) multiplayer strategy game. You'll strive to conquer volumetric planets against an AI or other players. Some planets are as you would expect: flat, hilly, covered by oceans. Others ... not so much. Feel free to design your own. Sometimes you will need to build bridges to reach your destination. Or it may be strategically useful to excavate tunnels or caves ... or to blow up a mountain. With more dimensions come more strategic options for you to exploit, but also more paths for your opponents to avoid your defenses. Resources never deplete, but the quest for ever more also never ends. And literally undermining someone else's mines can be surprisingly effective. In Hexaverse, good offense and defense requires diversity and cleverness. You typically don't build huge armies here, much less of only one type. Every single unit matters. A few artillery tanks in just the right spots might do all the damage you need. If that doesn't work, try nuking from sub-orbit. Be careful, though, not to rely on the unseen to remain as it appears.

The kingdom of Artoire was once a force to be reckoned with. Governed by a string of beloved kings, the nation was wealthy, its people prosperous. That was in the past, however. Now, Artoire’s fortunes are dwindling as constant wars and food shortages sweep the land. After innumerable hard years, the people of Artoire begin to despair. Fearing for the worst, they search for a messiah who can save them during their time of peril… And that messiah comes in the form of a fourteen-year-old girl called Liliane. Liliane is a beautiful, charming, elegant young lady from the foreign land of Charentes, born to the noble Saint-Coeurs. Betrothed to the future king of Artoire, Liliane ascends to the throne upon the death of the old monarch, to public approval and rapturous applause. With the passing of time, however, the public opinion towards Liliane turns. It soon transpires that the new queen is vain and flighty, and she cares not one jot about the plight of the common people. The death toll continues to rise, new wars loom on the horizon, and despair swells. Betrayed and helplessly hurt, a young man called Marius becomes a key player in a revolt that will shake the society of Artoire to its very core. Once a street urchin enamoured with the queen, and now a lead revolutionary, Marius is faced with a difficult decision. Can he really bring the queen he once adored to justice… or will his old feelings ruin all he has been working for?

In an attempt to change the tide of war and take the battle to the enemy the Terran military body, Galactic Command (GALCOM), has launched an all out attack on the Gammulan homeworlds. The events that take place in Angle Of Attack occur during the final days of the air campaign of the assault on LV-115 - an important planet used by the Gammulans for military purposes and as a staging area for their assault on GALCOM forces. The GALCOM forces, locked in a lopsided air campaign, made the decision to load the 'planet killer' R.A.N.D.O.M. weapon aboard the GCV-Excalibur for its ill-fated mission. GAMEPLAY HIGHLIGHTS No fancy console gimmicks here. Full 3D cockpits, advanced futuristic avionics and weapons delivery systems provide total immersion that air combat jocks have come to expect. Situational Awareness (SA) is the key to survival in a fluid battle for survival in which only your skills — not gimmicks — stand between fun and your will to continue the fight. Sixteen intense air and ground tactical strike missions in a variety of weather conditions, both day and night. Run each mission individually or in sequence as a single, seamless campaign. Play the whole campaign and each of the missions using any of the four fighters. Each craft has unique properties and weapon systems, providing exceptional replay value.

Using your VR controllers you can manipulate the objects to get a perfect view of every detail. Once you’ve explored the models you can teleport to the objects around the room which are created at an accurate human scale so you can get a real sense of what it is like to stand at the foot of the epic Saturn V rocket that took humans to the Moon and how the Soyuz craft which takes 3 Astronauts at a time plus supplies to the ISS is maybe smaller than you thought!

The second trailer is the same clip converted to 3D by Stream to 3D's offline conversion capability, in 3D Half SBS format. You can see that for yourself in 3D if you have a suitable viewer such as; Virtual Desktop, BigScreen or a VR headset browser. There are many more examples on the application website. The 2D input sample clips shown here have all been sourced as Free Stock Videos from Pexels.

Stream Video in Real-time Stream to 3D also provides first class support for video streaming, which means that you can now stream your real-time converted 2D to 3D videos to a host of new devices including your phone, tablet, laptop, Smart TV or Projector (both 3D and 2D devices are supported - via Colour Anaglyph 3D (Red/Cyan)) as well as stream direct to your VR headset. HTTP Streaming also supports subtitles and audio track selection.

Convert your 2D videos to 3D one at a time or in batch mode, allowing you to unleash the full potential of your video library. Play on-the-fly converted videos while the off-line conversion takes place in the background, maximising the utilisation of the resources of your machine to deliver the highest quality results. Off-line conversion also supports subtitles as well as videos with multiple audio tracks. Designed for the VR Community and Beyond Although providing full support for generalised 2D to 3D video conversion tasks, Stream to 3D has been crafted with particular attention to the needs of the VR community. We understand your desire for unparalleled experiences, and our software is optimised to work seamlessly with popular VR media player applications such as; Virtual Desktop, BigScreen, Pigasus and Sky Box VR Player (to name but a few). Combine Stream to 3D with PCVR media players like MPC-HC, PotPlayer, or VLC and unlock a world of 3D possibilities. Handle Any Resolution Video There are no software imposed limits on the resolution of the 2D input video and 3D output. A modest PCVR setup can easily handle 1080p conversion to 3D Full SBS output in real-time, 4K conversion to 3D in real-time is also possible with some parameter tuning. Frame Rate Conversion 3D output is generated at 24 FPS by default, but Stream to 3D can support output frame rates at up to 120 FPS, with a range of standard frame rates in between; 30, 48 and 60. Frame rate conversion is a resource intensive activity, but on a modest 3060 GPU based laptop (for example), real-time conversion frame rates of 48 FPS on 1080p input with HSBS 3D output is quite achievable. Obviously, unless you have a beast of a machine, the higher frame rates would be more appropriate to apply in off-line conversion. Seamless Integration with VR Headsets Stream to 3D makes it effortless to enjoy your favourite content in stunning 3D on VR headsets. Simply download the Stream to 3D PC Windows application, open your 2D video file (with support for a wide range of formats, including .mkv and .mp4), and witness your videos transform into breathtaking 3D experiences.

Controls: you can jump and run in any direction, but can only shoot up down left and right, with the heroes’ momentum the shot can slightly tilt in the current direction (leaning the shot). The Hero also has an action button when in front of specific targets can perform different task; open treasures, locked doors, push/pull objects, interact with puzzle Gameplay: The hero starts out with standard rpg stats (health, strength, shot speed, fire rate, and knockback) there are standard pick ups (heath, armour, bombs, keys, and coins) to collect when defeating enemies or completing rooms, as you play through the first level you come across a Treasure room, Shop room, or Mini boss. Treasure room: Every level has a Treasure room, in each Treasure room has a hero pick up that adds to you base stats Shop Room: Every level but the last will have a Shop room. Shop Rooms contains hero pick up items for sale, in Shop only items like, maps, compass, and one-time use hero items, as well some standard pick ups at a cheap price. Mini Boss Room: The Mini Boss room will contain boosted normal enemies with a different colour pallet, and small asset changes added. Drops for Mini bosses will be greater than standard enemies, with a small chance to drop a Treasure room item. Treasure, and Shop rooms require keys to enter Mini Boss rooms do not. Boss Room: Towards the end of the First level you will find the Boss room. Boss rooms have the entrance to the next level as well as the enemy boss. There are 3 different type of bosses for the first level, Warlock, Giant Blob, and Queen worm. Only 1 of the 3 will spawn, moving the other 2 for the next levels two and three. Once the Boss is defeated the entrance opens, and a Treasure room item spawns. Each level is basically the same structure, but with a different visual (cave, sewer, palace, hell) different puzzle themes (block, lemmings/pipes, teleport, wired colours) harder enemies. In short ever time you play you have the probability of a different game, with player choices determining some of the treasure pick ups, outcome of what bosses you fight, and levels you travel to.

Before you start a level, you must choose your difficulty: - Easy - 20 waves - Low Health Enemies - Medium - 40 waves - Mid Health Enemies - Hard - 60 waves - High Health Enemies Once you have completed a level, the button for the difficulty you have completed will turn green. If all three difficulties have been completed on a particular level, the button for that level will also turn green. Place turrets by choosing one from the shop menu and clicking on your desired position on the grid. Select turrets by clicking on an already placed turret. After selection it will open the upgrade menu which is full of information, e.g. Damage. It will also show you the range of the turret on the course. You can now Upgrade, Sell or Deselect your selected turret. Upgrade by clicking the 'Upgrade' button. It will cost 30% of the initial cost multiplied by the level you are currently on. Sell by clicking the 'Sell' button. You will receive 50% of the money you spent buying and upgrading the turret. Deselect by either clicking any empty space on the grid or selecting a different turret or building another turret. There are currently 6 pieces of information on the Game Board: - Your current money (Green) - The price of the turret you are hovering over in the shop menu (Red) - The current wave (Green) - The wave countdown timer (Red) - Your current health (Green) - Your remaining shield (Red) Green information will be there permanently. Red information will only show when necessary, e.g. when counting down for the next wave. You can also zoom in and out with the scroll wheel and move your camera around with WASD.

Take control over either the Axis or the Allies, while directing the efforts of each nation belonging to your alliance. From this unique perspective, you will be the supreme mastermind behind the entire conduct of operations, deciding the priorities, the strategies, and coordinating your global efforts to win the war! Each nation in your coalition will have their own strengths and weaknesses, levels of technology, troops, equipment, and industrial capacity, and it will be up to you to make the best use of all of them! Wage war across land, sea and air, employing a wide range of historical units combined with multiple avenues of technological upgrades. With research and development, the demands of combat and limited resources, balancing the day to day requirements of the war against your long term strategy will all be critical to ultimate success and victory. Diplomacy and espionage will also be key tools to employ against your enemy as a war like this cannot be fought solely with military forces. Manage your relationships with neutral powers – encourage or pressure them to join your alliance, support your war effort or deny their resources to the enemy! Through careful management of your resources, judicious research choices, wise strategic choices and brilliant deployment of your military plan, you can shape the outcome of this terrible conflict whilst continually competing against one of the most advanced AIs ever made. In Strategic Command the enemy will counter attack you every time, taking advantage of your weak points, setting traps for your forces, while waging a brutally efficient campaign on every front. Fury Software's aim with the Strategic Command series has always been to recreate World War II in a deep yet very accessible manner. Experienced wargamers will find much to love in it! MAIN FEATURES Take command of the two super coalitions, the Axis and the Allies, and re-fight WWII in Europe!

You play as Lucas, a retired royal servant whose dream is to start a hog farm business in his homeland. But heavy labour isn't the only obstacle that blocks your way to the dreamy future. With many monsters plus an unidentified fishy force that always eager to have both you and your hog's meat in their stomach, what can you do to survive in a harsh world without superpower or magical skill? Give up? Figh back? Run away? The answer is waiting for you in Hogvalord. KEY FEATURES Story-oriented gameplay : farming is not just for a living, farming is a part of the story. Figure out what has been threatening the peace of your homeland as the story progresses. Beware of choices, it can lead to a dreadful ending. Gathering : wander dangerous forests, collect resouces to build your farm. Design your own farm : build your farm however you like, be it a maze, a home or simply a dump. Just a small reminder, your farm is also your warzone 😄 Raise your hogs manually : provide them food, water or... weird potion. If they're happy, they can give birth to little piggy once in a lifetime. Hog evolution : 'piggy is what piggy eats', the food affect the hog's shape. Raise different type of hogs and evolve them into different mythical creatures. Yes, mythical creatures, maybe they aren't that useless after all. Combat : fight and defend the farm like a real medieval peasant. No magic, no superpower, time to work out some muscles and brain cells 😉 Growing crops : grow you own organic veggies to feed the hogs. No need to wait for the morning market anymore. Visual : top-down cute 3D graphics plus 2D beautiful hand painted character portraits &amp; illustrations.","['English', 'Vietnamese']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191730/header.jpg?t=1649145833,https://www.hogvalord.com,https://www.hogvalord.com,hogvalord@gmail.com,True,False,False,10,21011.31,Thap Tam Studio,Thap Tam Studio,"Single-player,Full controller support","Indie,RPG,Simulation,Strategy","Simulation,RPG,Agriculture,Survival,Base-Building,Time Management,Sandbox,Resource Management,Cartoony,Cartoon,Singleplayer,Isometric,Fantasy,2.5D,Indie,Casual,Farming Sim,Cute,Stylized,Top-Down","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191730/ss_40ecf2368873ddb63dd10a3c8d188ae372250fde.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649145833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191730/ss_416ddba2c13de5cdf3054a27abfc136faee043bf.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649145833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191730/ss_d46645df08aca4301af5519331fc9c267b998ed6.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649145833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191730/ss_7ed90636e6e8866fafac90172bceb0b4613385c5.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649145833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191730/ss_4804feec9860e25fbeb5e4fe3f9197ea902a407c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649145833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191730/ss_e2f494094f6e2606bd8d58d5f90aea8fadb25503.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649145833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191730/ss_a056a5ec3a2643b38258b69306c3b0e0b863e063.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649145833,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/1191730/ss_fe2d85e81408be3986d092083457aac5e1bebd9d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1649145833",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256834377/movie_max.mp4?t=1620814139

b73c05c07f824432917fb1419dc6880a,Flashback,"Oct 1, 2013",48,0,Everyone (E),9.99,0,"20 years after the original game’s launch , Conrad is enlisted back to active service for the triumphant return of one of the most acclaimed franchises in gaming history. It’s not a reboot. It’s Flashback re-imagined. The original Core-Team revamped their own creation, leveraging the best of today’s technology while remaining true to the classic side-scroller that set the standards of the genre in the 90’s. Key Features One of the best adventure-action games ever created re-imagined by its creators. It’s the same team. It’s the same passion. Only this time, they have had much more firepower at their disposal to recreate the legendary classic! Gorgeous graphics, amazing animations. It’s the Flashback you’ve always dreamed of. True to the original spirit but made a million times better by using modern engines such as Unreal and Havok. The makeover is completely stunning. It’s all about Gameplay. The team modernized gameplay mechanics, making the game more reactive, offering new features, like gadgets and an experience progression system. But the developers kept the original formula in mind: a fine balance between rolling and shooting, exploring remote space stations and obliterating hostile alien planets. Bringing back new memories. The story was revamped to speak to 21st century gamers.

Befriend other gods and use magic to help your residents build the town, thereby earning the offerings of your people and growing your town. Town Construction As the local land god, your primary task is to watch over and guide your people as you build the town from scratch. Collect natural resources, build production and living facilities, and produce essential supplies to bring peace and prosperity to your people. Residents and Life The residents have their own preferences and emotions. They are happy when they have nice houses to live in, and will become distressed if they don't have any entertainment. Try to observe them and build housing, arrange jobs, and provide education and necessary leisure and entertainment. Make their wishes come true to earn their worship and trust. Gods and Magic As a local land god, you have access to some basic magic like changing the location of things in town. If you want to use stronger magic, you'll have to use the offerings of your people to meet other gods that can lend you their power and help develop your town. For example, the Moon Elder can greatly increase your people's willingness to get married and have kids, while the Weather Master can help you control the weather... Buildings and Decoration You can build and upgrade dozens of different buildings to provide your people with a better living and working environment. In addition, this game also provides hundreds of unique decorations, each with its own style. As you decorate your town, you'll find that some decorations have unique combination effects. Try out different combinations to trigger effects that will make your town more beautiful and prosperous. Monsters and Puppets The town isn't always a peaceful place. Prosperous towns attract monsters that will come to destroy your buildings and take away your resources. You can build city walls and towers to delay monster attacks, and can also use spells as you lead your residents in battle to repel the monsters with the help of battle puppets.

It includes a full featured ballistics calculator allowing the simulation of any type of ammunition and simulates several categories of scopes including front focal plane, second focal plane, dual focal plane scopes and digital scopes. It even allows the user to design and load your own scope reticle. The goal of Expert Rifleman is to let you gain proficiency at shooting stationary and moving targets without expending valuable ammo or barrel life. Use preloaded ammo types or create your own ammo by entering ballistic data. The simulation will let you practice shooting in different environmental conditions, try out zeros at different ranges and set the conditions under which your rifle is zeroed. Expert Rifleman features a realistic 3D environment where the user can train in scenarios not commonly available such as engaging long range moving targets and high angle shooting. The scope reticles in Expert Rifleman are calibrated in Mil-rads or MOA and function identically to the real thing. Learn how to use a reticle to range targets and calculate hold over. The simulation allows the user to compensate for the forces which affect the path of the bullet. Vegetation sways and bends and particles follow the wind currents. You can visualize wind direction and intensity. Compare ammunition based on ballistic performance. The only thing which Expert Rifleman cannot do is teach you how to pull the trigger! Pick between the following ammo types or create your own by entering ballistics data: 7.62 NATO .338 Lapua Magnum .50 BMG Up to 500 user created ammunition types. Expert Rifleman is built around an advanced ballistic calculator which calculates: Gravity and air resistance Bore angle Aerodynamic jump Scope height over bore Horizontal and vertical coriolis drift Wind drift from arbitrary wind direction including head wind Spin drift Density altitude and several minor corrections Three types of targets: Mobile target Flip target Flip and hostage target Four different maps each with multiple target ranges. You can place a target on any of the maps by pressing enter. The dynamic target map lets you practice shooting at moving targets. The high angle map lets you practice shooting at an angle. The sandbox map lets you place the target and set its distance, orientation and speed on a flat map. The 360-degree map has ranges out to 1500 yards. Users can engage targets in a 360 arc, allowing the simulation of Coriolis drift. Internal Ballistics features: Adjust for powder temperature User defined random projectile mass and ammunition pressure variation. Expert rifleman comes preloaded with a number of preset scopes and reticles. In addition you can easily create your own scope by loading a custom image file and entering a few variables. Scopes can use either the mil rad or moa systems.",['English'],[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/header.jpg?t=1458760779,http://www.battlebyte.com/expert-rifleman,,contact@battlebyte.com,True,True,False,0,35669.17,BattleByte,BattleByte,"Single-player,Steam Trading Cards,Steam Workshop",Simulation,Simulation,"https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_932cf67789ba13e20ccb567b998566f2e115244c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_44ddb4a1cffdaaf15b287e0b1f3397c52b72cfe1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_0a28a5a0f3aa5d7179fb1922a453b6ef1f2b5c71.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_9cbfad1f78c3db01744e18461c52a10cf0a862ba.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_270474820a0ab72b85f99272909bd2e73226d845.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_efc65970ea337b59bea71585a29697c90dc9c7d4.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_44ddb4a1cffdaaf15b287e0b1f3397c52b72cfe1.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_655245e769d41ba06a2ba557569937341a0e97fb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_05bb5654590d74ab2c57feaad24626848fe13aec.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_5f599bd0e76e4fa3f6e5de44a5043b8aa761fbc8.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_debfd61e18623f8da7e503ad32f8d7f1d3a74d6c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_f0a99db484b65171f7a6e7e1eaca48e053ff0d3e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_b29314bbdf0b65cc4e3f94a96b362a380c823ffb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_18925a4c506af3fdafcabb5cc325046390b613a9.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_84bb849a849d84e14333b67b5d59c383a7436449.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_34f7dfea6c8d36a7da3d089c44a0345718fb2194.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/383590/ss_abae4082ebef78c1388cbdab146312652bb00ce3.1920x1080.jpg?t=1458760779",http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256655406/movie_max.mp4?t=1447377440

Summon elements: Different from minions in MTG and Hearthstone, elements in our game die after attacking once. Weapon: Triggers special effects when launching basic attacks. Shield: Triggers special effects when Hero’s armor is attacked. Besides, details of the design progress of Axeman: Elemental Troop (90%), Elemental Combo (90%), Pure Attacker (60%) Archer (Design Progress: 40%) Equipped with an op “Artifact”, the Quiver, at the beginning of the game, which reduces the cost of cards in your hand every turn. Therefore, for Archer, the cost of cards equals their CD. This design will change the gaming experience players will have when playing as the Archer. Besides, details of the design progress of Archer: Combo Main (40%), Cards Accumulating (40%) Wizard (Primary Design Phase) The energy system of Wizard is different from that of the other classes—Wizard needs to obtain mana of three colors by using “Mana Cards” first and then he can use cards of the corresponding color. Swordsman (Primary Design Phase) Swordsman is an excellent commander and can enroll NPCs that are willing to follow him. General System The core system of the game is basically finished. There are other systems that have been listed: Difficulty Higher Difficulty levels will be unlocked after playthroughs under lower ones. Besides, the current Difficulty level is a bit too low so we'll adjust it. Blessings A growth system that improves characters outside of battles. Others More enemies, artifacts, equipment, and items. Planning But No Guarantee Branch Areas. For example, after clearing this first large area, you can choose to enter a different second large area. Different areas have different enemies, events, etc. We’re trying to make the game “thicker” and design more types of enemies and events. 2. The Fifth Class: Werewolf.

Three heroes under the spiritual guidance of a mighty dragon-guardian, united on a mission to save the vast and diverse lands of Nogard from chaos and extinction. Shards of Nogard is a powerful, evocative fantasy adventure game that will surprise you with fastpaced combat, mind-boggling puzzles, beautiful hand-crafted environments and an immersive story about the eternal battle between the sanguine powers of fire and blood on the one hand, and the unyielding strength of hope on the other. Characters Each of the three characters have a history of their own, which can be explored through in-game interactions, dialogues, and mini questlines. Using these three unique characters and their specific skills, players can craft their own distinct experience and hone develop their personal playstyle as they jump, hack and slash their way through haunted forests, cursed underwater realms and raging hellfire. As players search for the shards of Nogard to restore an ancient artifact that will restore peace and harmony, they will explore a handcrafted world full of adorable NPCs, sly and shady characters and breath-taking cities and sceneries. Take a break from all the fighting and solve a puzzle. Or talk your way through branching dialogues, make friends, and receive gifts and useful information that will make you better prepared than ever. Pick up the shards! Developed by a young and passionate team hailing from diverse countries and backgrounds, Shards of Nogard aspires to be a truly magical tale about maintaining hope and purpose in a disenchanted world consumed by the insatiable flames of war. Striking a fine balance between a platformer game and a colourful action RPG, players can switch back and forth between three different character: 1. the optimistic and hedonistic warlord Torus 2. the stern and sometimes overthinking magician Alva 3. the cynical yet hopelessly romantic assassin Zonder. Pretty much like in real life, you can make friends and enemies. Use your companions wisely and always think through your options, not only when you let your weapons do the talking. The result will be a game experience that rewards you with true immersion and a sense of magic and discovery that will carry over into your daily lives!",['English'],['English'],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/header.jpg?t=1685549412,https://shardsofnogard.com/,https://shardsofnogard.com/,info@blockcode.hr,True,False,False,0,18051.79,Blockcode Games,Blockcode Games,"Single-player,Full controller support","Action,Adventure,Indie,RPG","Action-Adventure,RPG,Fantasy,Story Rich,Cartoony,Female Protagonist,Mythology,Medieval,Platformer,Action RPG,Action,2D Platformer,Adventure,Puzzle-Platformer,Side Scroller,2D,Hand-drawn,Controller,Narration,Singleplayer","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_f06fb893f29cd22118b84ae93fb0f2c9f8ac9894.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_2095426e788bd361a95f56606deac28089abb86c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_ef4ecf8b0775e9c8f1679e00247d3ba3b131c120.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_cc55e5c1a3d7aafd7a231856f07f79f859ea7139.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_85c3323c8d8a8412f12b5481dba4c1c435b4aefb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_da37225353df52149383b9c9dd7a4144e4554aa0.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_f1da49b88c7847c7d8dc25d5fcc66ccc658f7026.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_537080e11866b24020d850cf04b6a91874c17e2e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_88a90ed0a5089cfd7945afb852a4d0f5c0ca7068.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_82dac9eaf55dc5b9f0aaf68924993cb5bee855eb.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_c2934fc3041e1ad9fe6854747144e367ef24947e.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_5c548e4c7d3d5fcb1aa5d3dec6a607996ac2c1ac.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_7e234944f5e976dcc39da4a188ecc2f400b8cc5b.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_c5196db596cf9c6a518b57a57267baec8787978d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_b3689618ad18fca2ed8e25b7b9411e2694e0870a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/2021040/ss_00c047f61b007719de980707c94cb162cd9333cc.1920x1080.jpg?t=1685549412","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256890542/movie_max.mp4?t=1656875386,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256893101/movie_max.mp4?t=1655919441"

42720a0ac3ec43bc90d59b2571d092de,Voxel Blast,"Oct 22, 2015",55,0,Everyone (E),11.99,0,"Voxel Blast is a game where you control a spaceship traveling across complex 3D environments to fight enemies in cages set to trap them with you. Navigate as fast as you can through the level to reach the beacons or risk facing squads of enemies already waiting for you; then use your weapons and evasive maneuvers to take them down in bright colorful explosions. An electric neon, colorful yet sparse look is the inspiration for all the elements in the game; the setting, the player ships, enemies, visual effects and music take notes from simple vector art and electronic music. Voxel Blast was created as a love letter to 3D dogfighting games and also space shooters, in an attempt to find a common ground between those two kinds of games. In Voxel Blast you can choose one of three ships with different weapons, yet all of them very focused in providing a satisfying dog-fighting style and movement. The game has three modes to learn and test the skills necessary for the player to succeed: the Challenge mode, the Survival mode and the Arcade. The Challenge mode consist in a series of courses marked trough navigation beacons with limited time to reach them; this mode teaches the player the necessary skills to fly and navigate the spaceships in a safer environment that the arcade with lower stakes overall, but with a focus on high speed precise flying. The Survival mode presents the player with an arena much like the ones in the Arcade mode, but in a three-lives endless score-attack combat with a constant flow of a varied mix of enemies; in the survival mode the player can see all the enemies he might find in the Arcade and develop ways to fight them, including the interactions between different compositions of enemies. The Arcade mode combines the combat and navigation in stages comprised of sets of flying sections and fighting gauntlets, where the number of destroyed enemies and the time taken to complete count towards the final score. The game features gamepad support for analog direct input and some flightsticks, but it has been designed to be played with a mouse and keyboard using a system that tries to reproduce the nuance of using a stick to control the roll and pitch of the spaceship. This makes the control of the ship one of the main skills to master in the game, along with the speed control, positional engagement of enemies and management of special projectiles.","['English', 'Spanish - Spain']",[],,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/header.jpg?t=1633624285,http://www.ceibasoft.net/projects/voxel-blast/,https://www.facebook.com/voxelblast,info@ceibasoft.net,True,True,True,50,7214.42,Ceiba Software and Arts,Ceiba Software and Arts,"Single-player,Multi-player,Cross-Platform Multiplayer,Steam Achievements,Full controller support,Steam Trading Cards,Stats,Steam Leaderboards","Action,Indie","Action,Indie","https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/ss_85c275e20b681dd9b8fac4592f24dbc2da13f96f.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/ss_084c1157fa69910a46e3ad4c7e8e550d04760f7d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/ss_30b7f9190032ea31da8353bf4cd2fa9bf040234a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/ss_19509110582c910e02dcfd8489ee3371e4aed60c.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/ss_82dbbdc4652cdccd299e78a8217878994f8f7957.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/ss_7d46c7facfcddea7be2f5edff163e5199b5cd82a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/ss_1a073524d49aa7d485d91e5ce498b373bf05d54d.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/ss_484d2a05316fbd62862ab5c36ff661fc19afcb24.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285,https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/395300/ss_7687c39dc181510f83b83f8d56ee09384636159a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1633624285","http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256657196/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378440,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256656859/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378292,http://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/256656400/movie_max.mp4?t=1447378048"

Now in her early twenties, she’s abandoned that dream to focus on her uninspiring job as a computer repair technician. There’s not enough time in the day to focus on game development – and anyway, isn’t she too old to entertain such unrealistic notions? That is, until her childhood friend, Clover, introduces her to the seductive Suki. Suki is determined to turn Nekohime’s dream into a reality and finally develop a game – and she refuses to let Nekohime’s self-doubt stop her. Whether she wants to or not, Nekohime’s pulled into a brand new world, alongside these two bubbly, optimistic girls. Will they be able to make a hit game together, or will it all be for nought? And, in the end, will Nekohime manage to find true love? The unwilling heroine of the story. Her real name is ‘Sayo’, but her friends refer to her by her internet handle - much to her embarrassment. Though she dislikes being referred to by a silly nickname she made up on the spot when she was a kid, she exhibits a lot of catlike traits. She’s always seen in her cat-eared jacket, she likes taking naps, and she can be rather ‘catty’. She lacks purpose in life, and is bored by her tedious, unrewarding job. Maybe making a video game is exactly the kind of diversion she needs. One of Nekohime’s closest friends. Her real name is Chika. Though she loves revealing cosplay and dressing in tightly-fitting spandex, she’s actually an elementary school teacher. She’s warm, cheerful, bubbly, and loves playing around with finger paints, which makes her a surprisingly good fit for her job (and no, she doesn’t dress quite so outlandishly when she’s at work). Being creative, she enjoys experimenting in the kitchen and composing music. She nominates herself as the composer for her video game venture. A mischievous, vixen-like girl from Nekohime’s past, infamous for encouraging her elderly grandmother to feed her laptop’s D-Drive rice for a ‘Shinto purification ceremony’. Suki flirts with almost everyone, to such an extent it’s hard to tell whether she really means it. She also enjoys teasing people – particularly uptight people like Nekohime who get flustered easily. She grew up in a shrine, but is worlds apart from the image of a ‘traditional Japanese beauty’. She can be loud and obnoxious and incredibly pushy, but she’ll apologize when she realizes she’s gone too far. She’s also a competent digital artist, who spent a large portion of her life drawing and uploading her pictures online. After all, there’s not much else to do at a shrine.

Features Uncover the Truth, Take Back Redfall The island town of Redfall, Massachusetts, is under siege by a legion of vampires who have blocked out the sun and cut the citizens off from the outside world. Explore the open world and immerse yourself in a deep story campaign as you unravel the mystery behind the vampires’ appearance. Ally with a handful of survivors against the creatures threatening to bleed the town dry.

Unconventional Heroes Vs. the Night Created by science experiments gone wrong and gifted with psychic abilities, Redfall’s vampires will challenge you and your squad to get creative. You will choose from a team of diverse heroes – each with their own character-specific abilities – to overcome the vampire legion and their brood of maniacal followers.
